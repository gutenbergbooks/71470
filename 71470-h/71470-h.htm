<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>This poem was commenced at Keswick, Dec. 2.
1809, and finished there July 14. 1814.</p>

<p>A French translation, by M. B. de S., in three
volumes 12mo., was published in 1820, and another
by M. le Chevalier ⸺ in one volume 8vo., 1821.
Both are in prose.</p>

<p>When the latest of these versions was nearly
ready for publication, the publisher, who was also
the printer, insisted upon having a life of the author
prefixed. The French public, he said, knew nothing
of M. Southey, and in order to make the
book sell, it must be managed to interest them for
the writer. The Chevalier represented as a conclusive
reason for not attempting any thing of the
kind, that he was not acquainted with M. Southey’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
private history. “Would you believe it?” says a
friend of the translator’s, from whose letter I transscribe
what follows; “this was his answer <i>verbatim</i>:
‘<i>N’importe, écrivez toujours; brodez, brodez-la
un peu; que ce soit vrai ou non ce ne fait rien;
qui prendra la peine de s’informer?</i>’” Accordingly
a <i>Notice sur M. Southey</i> was composed, not exactly
in conformity with the publisher’s notions of biography,
but from such materials as could be collected
from magazines and other equally unauthentic
sources.</p>

<p>In one of these versions a notable mistake occurs,
occasioned by the French pronunciation of an
English word. The whole passage indeed, in both
versions, may be regarded as curiously exemplifying
the difference between French and English
poetry.</p>

<p><i>Il se livrait à toutes ces réflexions, quand la lumière
des lampes et des cierges commença à pâlir,
et que les premières teintes de l’aurore se montrèrent
à travers les hautes croisées tournées vers l’orient.
Le retour du jour ne ramena point dans ces murs
des sons joyeux ni les mouvemens de la vie qui se
réveille; les seuls papillons de nuit, agitant leurs
ailes pesantes, bourdonnaient encore sous les voûtes
ténébreuses. Bientôt le premier rayon du soleil
glissant obliquement par-dessus l’autel, vint s’arrêter
sur la tombe de la femme pécheresse, et la lumière
du ciel sembla y pénétrer. “Que ce présage s’accomplisse,”
s’écria Pelage, qui absorbé dans ses méditations,
fixait en ce moment ses yeux sur le tombeau
de sa mere; “Dieu de miséricorde, qu’il en soit ainsi!
Puisse ta bonté vivifiante y verser de même le pardon!
Que les sanglots de la pénitence expirante, et que mes
prières amères ne montent point en vain devant
le trône éternel. Et toi, pauvre âme, qui de ton
séjour douloureux de souffrances et de larmes, espères
en moi pour abréger et adoucir ton supplice, temporaire,
pardonne moi d’avoir, sous ces habits et
dans cette nuit, détourné mes pensées sur d’autres
devoirs. Notre patrie commune a exigé de moi ce
sacrifice, et ton fils doit dorénavant accomplir plus
d’une veille dans la profondeur des forêts, sur la cime
des monts, dans les plaines couvertes de tentes, observant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
pour l’amour de l’Espagne, la marche des
astres de la nuit, et préparant l’ouvrage de sa journée
avant que le soleil ne commence sa course.</i>”—T. i.
pp. 175-177.</p>

<p>In the other translation the <i>motes</i> are not converted
into moths,—but the image is omitted.</p>

<p><i>Consumées dans des soins pareils les rapides heures
s’écouloient, les lampes et les torches commençoient à
pâlir, et l’oblique rayon du matin doroit déjà les
vitraux élevés qui regardoient vers l’Orient: le retour
du jour ne ramenoit point, dans cette sombre enceinte,
les sons joyeux, ni le tableau mouvant de la vie qui
se reveille; mais, tombant d’en haut, le céleste rayon,
passant au-dessus de l’autel, vint frapper le tombeau de
la femme pécheresse. “Ainsi soit-il,” s’écria Pelage;
“ainsi soit-il, ô divin Créateur! Puisse ta vivifiante
bonté verser ainsi le pardon en ce lieu! Que les
gémissemens d’une mort pénitente, que mes amères

<p>A very good translation in Dutch verse, was
published in two volumes, 8vo. 1823-4, with this
title:—“Rodrigo de Goth, Koning van Spanje.
Naar het Engelsch van Southey gevolgd, door
Vrouwe Katharina Wilhelmina Bilderdijk. Te
’s Gravenhage.” It was sent to me with the following
epistle from her husband, Mr. Willem Bilderdijk.</p>

Gulielmus Bilderdijk, S. P. D.</p>

<p>“Etsi ea nunc temporis passim invaluerit opinio,

cæteris e meliori luto finxerit præcordia Titan, neque
aut verè aut justè judicari vatem nisi ab iis qui

perpetuus contemptor; parcus ipse laudator, censor
gravis et nonnunquam molestus. Tuum vero nomen,
Vir celeberrime ac spectatissime, jam antea veneratus,
perlecto tuo de Roderico rege poëmate, non
potui non summis extollere laudibus, quo doctissimo

Ne mireris itaque, carminis tui gravitate ac dulcedine

<p>I went to Leyden in 1825, for the purpose of
seeing the writer of this epistle, and the lady who
had translated my poem, and addressed it to me in
some very affecting stanzas. It so happened, that
on my arrival in that city, I was laid up under a
surgeon’s care; they took me into their house, and
made the days of my confinement as pleasurable
as they were memorable. I have never been acquainted
with a man of higher intellectual power,
nor of greater learning, nor of more various and
extensive knowledge than Bilderdijk, confessedly
the most distinguished man of letters in his own
country. His wife was worthy of him. I paid
them another visit the following year. They are
now both gone to their rest, and I shall not look
upon their like again.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of Roderick, I received
the following curious letter from the Ettrick
Shepherd, (who had passed a few days with me in
the preceding autumn,) giving me an account of
his endeavours to procure a favourable notice of
the poem in the Edinburgh Review.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Edinburgh, Dec. 15. 1814.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“I was very happy at seeing the post-mark of
Keswick, and quite proud of the pleasure you make
me believe my “Wake” has given to the beauteous
and happy groupe at Greta Hall. Indeed few
things could give me more pleasure, for I left my
heart a sojourner among them. I have had a
higher opinion of matrimony since that period than
ever I had before, and I desire that you will positively
give my kindest respects to each of them
individually.</p>

<p>“The Pilgrim of the Sun is published, as you will
see by the Papers, and if I may believe some communications
that I have got, the public opinion of
it is high; but these communications to an author
are not to be depended on.</p>

<p>“I have read Roderick over and over again, and
am the more and more convinced that it is the
noblest epic poem of the age. I have had some
correspondence and a good deal of conversation
with Mr. Jeffrey about it, though he does not agree
with me in every particular. He says it is too
long, and wants <i>elasticity</i>, and will not, he fears, be
generally read, though much may be said in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
favour. I had even teazed him to let me review it
for him, on account, as I said, that he could not
appreciate its merits. I copy one sentence out of
the letter he sent in answer to mine:—</p>

<p>“‘For Southey I have, as well as you, great respect,
and when he will let me, great admiration; but he
is a most provoking fellow, and at least as conceited
as his neighbour Wordsworth. I cannot just trust
you with his Roderick; but I shall be extremely
happy to talk over that and other kindred subjects
with you; for I am every way disposed to give
Southey a lavish allowance of praise, and few
things would give me greater pleasure than to find
he had afforded me a fair opportunity. But I must
do my duty according to my own apprehensions
of it.’</p>

<p>“I supped with him last night, but there was so
many people that I got but little conversation with
him, but what we had was solely about you and
Wordsworth. I suppose you have heard what a
crushing review he has given the latter. I still
found him persisting in his first asseveration, that it
was heavy; but what was my pleasure to find that
he had only got to the seventeenth division. I
assured him he had the marrow of the thing to
come at as yet, and in that I was joined by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
Alison. There was at the same time a Lady M⸺
joined us at the instant; short as her remark was,
it seemed to make more impression on Jeffrey than
all our arguments:—“Oh, I do love Southey!”
that was all.</p>

<p>“I have no room to tell you more. But I beg
that you will not do any thing, nor publish any
thing that will nettle Jeffrey for the present, knowing
as you do how omnipotent he is with the fashionable
world, and seemingly so well disposed toward you.</p>

looked at them. I wish these large quartos were

<p>The reader will be as much amused as I was with
poor Hogg’s earnest desire that I would not say
any thing which might tend to frustrate his friendly
intentions.</p>

</div>

<p>The history of the Wisi-Goths for some years
before their overthrow is very imperfectly known.
It is, however, apparent, that the enmity between
the royal families of Chindasuintho and Wamba
was one main cause of the destruction of the kingdom,
the latter party having assisted in betraying
their country to the Moors for the gratification of
their own revenge. Theodofred and Favila were
younger sons of King Chindasuintho; King Witiza,
who was of Wamba’s family, put out the eyes of
Theodofred, and murdered Favila, at the instigation
of that Chieftain’s wife, with whom he lived in
adultery. Pelayo, the son of Favila, and afterwards
the founder of the Spanish monarchy, was driven
into exile. Roderick, the son of Theodofred, recovered
the throne, and put out Witiza’s eyes in
vengeance for his father; but he spared Orpas, the
brother of the tyrant, as being a Priest, and Ebba
and Sisibert, the two sons of Witiza, by Pelayo’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span>
mother. It may be convenient thus briefly to premise
these circumstances of an obscure portion of
history, with which few readers can be supposed to
be familiar; and a list of the principal persons who
are introduced, or spoken of, may as properly be
prefixed to a Poem as to a Play.</p>

<p>The four latter persons are imaginary. All the others
are mentioned in history. I ought, however, to observe, that
Romano is a creature of monkish legends; that the name of
Pelayo’s sister has not been preserved; and that that of Roderick’s
mother, Ruscilo, has been altered to Rusilla, for the
sake of euphony.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">He cast aside, and taking from the dead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A peasant’s garment, in those weeds involved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stole like a thief in darkness from the field.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Evening closed round to favour him. All night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He fled, the sound of battle in his ear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ringing, and sights of death before his eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With forms more horrible of eager fiends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That seem’d to hover round, and gulphs of fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opening beneath his feet. At times the groan</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of some poor fugitive, who, bearing with him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His mortal hurt, had fallen beside the way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roused him from these dread visions, and he call’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In answering groans on his Redeemer’s name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That word the only prayer that pass’d his lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or rose within his heart. Then would he see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Cross whereon a bleeding Saviour hung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who call’d on him to come and cleanse his soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In those all-healing streams, which from his wounds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As from perpetual springs, for ever flow’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No hart e’er panted for the water-brooks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As Roderick thirsted there to drink and live:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Hell was interposed; and worse than Hell ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea to his eyes more dreadful than the fiends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who flock’d like hungry ravens round his head, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Florinda stood between, and warn’d him off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With her abhorrent hands, ... that agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still in her face, which, when the deed was done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inflicted on her ravisher the curse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That it invoked from Heaven.... Oh what a night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of waking horrors! Nor when morning came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did the realities of light and day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bring aught of comfort; wheresoe’er he went</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tidings of defeat had gone before;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leaving their defenceless homes to seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What shelter walls and battlements might yield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old men with feeble feet, and tottering babes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And widows with their infants in their arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurried along. Nor royal festival,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor sacred pageant, with like multitudes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’er fill’d the public way. All whom the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had spared were here; bed-rid infirmity</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alone was left behind; the cripple plied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His crutches, with her child of yesterday</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mother fled, and she whose hour was come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell by the road.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">Less dreadful than this view</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of outward suffering which the day disclosed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had night and darkness seem’d to Roderick’s heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all their dread creations. From the throng</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He turn’d aside, unable to endure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This burthen of the general woe; nor walls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor towers, nor mountain fastnesses he sought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A firmer hold his spirit yearn’d to find,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A rock of surer strength. Unknowing where,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Straight through the wild he hasten’d on all day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with unslacken’d speed was travelling still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When evening gather’d round. Seven days from morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till night he travell’d thus; the forest oaks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fig-grove by the fearful husbandman</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forsaken to the spoiler, and the vines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where fox and household dog together now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fed on the vintage, gave him food; the hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Heaven was on him, and the agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which wrought within, supplied a strength beyond</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All natural force of man.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">When the eighth eve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was come, he found himself on Ana’s banks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fast by the Caulian Schools. It was the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of vespers, but no vesper bell was heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor other sound, than of the passing stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or stork, who flapping with wide wing the air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sought her broad nest upon the silent tower.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brethren and pupils thence alike had fled</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To save themselves within the embattled walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of neighbouring Merida. One aged Monk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alone was left behind; he would not leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacred spot beloved, for having served</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There from his childhood up to ripe old age</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God’s holy altar, it became him now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He thought, before that altar to await</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The merciless misbelievers, and lay down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His life, a willing martyr. So he staid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all were gone, and duly fed the lamps,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kept devotedly the altar drest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And duly offer’d up the sacrifice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Four days and nights he thus had pass’d alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In such high mood of saintly fortitude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hope of Heaven became a heavenly joy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now at evening to the gate he went</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he might spy the Moors, ... for it seem’d long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To tarry for his crown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Before the Cross</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick had thrown himself; his body raised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half kneeling, half at length he lay; his arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embraced its foot, and from his lifted face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tears streaming down bedew’d the senseless stone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had not wept till now, and at the gush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of these first tears, it seem’d as if his heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From a long winter’s icey thrall let loose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had open’d to the genial influences</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Heaven. In attitude, but not in act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of prayer he lay; an agony of tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was all his soul could offer. When the Monk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld him suffering thus, he raised him up,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And took him by the arm, and led him in;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there before the altar, in the name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Him whose bleeding image there was hung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spake comfort, and adjured him in that name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There to lay down the burthen of his sins.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo! said Romano, I am waiting here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The coming of the Moors, that from their hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My spirit may receive the purple robe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of martyrdom, and rise to claim its crown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That God who willeth not the sinner’s death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath led thee hither. Threescore years and five,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even from the hour when I, a five-years child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enter’d the schools, have I continued here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And served the altar: not in all those years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath such a contrite and a broken heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Appear’d before me. O my brother, Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath sent thee for thy comfort, and for mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That my last earthly act may reconcile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sinner to his God.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Then Roderick knelt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the holy man, and strove to speak.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou seest, he cried, ... thou seest, ... but memory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And suffocating thoughts repress’d the word,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shudderings like an ague fit, from head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To foot convulsed him; till at length, subduing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His nature to the effort, he exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spreading his hands and lifting up his face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if resolved in penitence to bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A human eye upon his shame, ... Thou seest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick the Goth! That name would have sufficed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To tell its whole abhorred history:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He not the less pursued, ... the ravisher,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cause of all this ruin! Having said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the same posture motionless he knelt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arms straighten’d down, and hands outspread, and eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raised to the Monk, like one who from his voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awaited life or death.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">All night the old man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pray’d with his penitent, and minister’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unto the wounded soul, till he infused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A healing hope of mercy that allay’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its heat of anguish. But Romano saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What strong temptations of despair beset,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how he needed in this second birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even like a yearling child, a fosterer’s care.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father in Heaven, he cried, thy will be done!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surely I hoped that I this day should sing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hosannahs at thy throne; but thou hast yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Work for thy servant here. He girt his loins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from her altar took with reverent hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our Lady’s image down: In this, quoth he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We have our guide and guard and comforter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The best provision for our perilous way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fear not but we shall find a resting place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Almighty’s hand is on us.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">They went forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They cross’d the stream, and when Romano turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his last look toward the Caulian towers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far off the Moorish standards in the light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of morn were glittering, where the miscreant host</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward the Lusitanian capital</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lay their siege advanced; the eastern breeze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bore to the fearful travellers far away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sound of horn and tambour o’er the plain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All day they hasten’d, and when evening fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sped toward the setting sun, as if its line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of glory came from Heaven to point their course.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But feeble were the feet of that old man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For such a weary length of way; and now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Being pass’d the danger (for in Merida</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sacaru long in resolute defence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Withstood the tide of war,) with easier pace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wanderers journey’d on; till having cross’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rich Tagus, and the rapid Zezere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They from Albardos’ hoary height beheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pine-forest, fruitful vale, and that fair lake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Alcoa, mingled there with Baza’s stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rests on its passage to the western sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sea the aim and boundary of their toil.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The fourth week of their painful pilgrimage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was full, when they arrived where from the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A rocky hill, rising with steep ascent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’erhung the glittering beach; there on the top</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little lowly hermitage they found,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a rude Cross, and at its foot a grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bearing no name, nor other monument.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where better could they rest than here, where faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And secret penitence and happiest death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had bless’d the spot, and brought good Angels down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And open’d as it were a way to Heaven?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behind them was the desert, offering fruit</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And water for their need: on either side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The white sand sparkling to the sun; in front,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great Ocean with its everlasting voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in perpetual jubilee, proclaim’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wonders of the Almighty, filling thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pauses of their fervent orisons.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where better could the wanderers rest than here?</div>

RODERICK IN SOLITUDE.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Twelve months they sojourn’d in their solitude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then beneath the burthen of old age</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Romano sunk. No brethren were there here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To spread the sackcloth, and with ashes strew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That penitential bed, and gather round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To sing his requiem, and with prayer and psalm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assist him in his hour of agony.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He lay on the bare earth, which long had been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His only couch; beside him Roderick knelt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moisten’d from time to time his blacken’d lips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received a blessing with his latest breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then closed his eyes, and by the nameless grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the fore-tenant of that holy place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Consign’d him earth to earth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">Two graves are here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Roderick transverse at their feet began</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To break the third. In all his intervals</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of prayer, save only when he search’d the woods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fill’d the water-cruise, he labour’d there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the work was done, and he had laid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Himself at length within its narrow sides</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And measured it, he shook his head to think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was no other business now for him.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor wretch, thy bed is ready, he exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And would that night were come!... It was a task,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All gloomy as it was, which had beguiled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sense of solitude; but now he felt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The burthen of the solitary hours:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The silence of that lonely hermitage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay on him like a spell; and at the voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his own prayers, he started half aghast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then too as on Romano’s grave he sate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pored upon his own, a natural thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arose within him, ... well might he have spared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That useless toil; the sepulchre would be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No hiding place for him; no Christian hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were here who should compose his decent corpse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cover it with earth. There he might drag</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wretched body at its passing hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But there the Sea-Birds of her heritage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would rob the worm, or peradventure seize,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere death had done its work, their helpless prey.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even now they did not fear him: when he walk’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside them on the beach, regardlessly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They saw his coming; and their whirring wings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the height had sometimes fann’d his cheek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if, being thus alone, humanity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had lost its rank, and the prerogative</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of man were done away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">For his lost crown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sceptre never had he felt a thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of pain; repentance had no pangs to spare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For trifles such as these, ... the loss of these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was a cheap penalty; ... that he had fallen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down to the lowest depth of wretchedness,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hope and consolation. But to lose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His human station in the scale of things, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see brute nature scorn him, and renounce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its homage to the human form divine; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had then Almighty vengeance thus reveal’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His punishment, and was he fallen indeed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Below fallen man, below redemption’s reach, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made lower than the beasts, and like the beasts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To perish!... Such temptations troubled him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By day, and in the visions of the night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And even in sleep he struggled with the thought.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And waking with the effort of his prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dream assail’d him still.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">A wilder form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sometimes his poignant penitence assumed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starting with force revived from intervals</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of calmer passion, or exhausted rest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When floating back upon the tide of thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remembrance to a self-excusing strain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beguiled him, and recall’d in long array</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sorrows and the secret impulses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which to the abyss of wretchedness and guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Led their unwary victim. The evil hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Return’d upon him, when reluctantly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yielding to worldly counsel his assent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In wedlock to an ill-assorted mate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He gave his cold unwilling hand: then came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The disappointment of the barren bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hope deceived, the soul dissatisfied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Home without love, and privacy from which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Delight was banish’d first, and peace too soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Departed. Was it strange that when he met</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A heart attuned, ... a spirit like his own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of lofty pitch, yet in affection mild,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tender as a youthful mother’s joy, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh was it strange if at such sympathy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The feelings which within his breast repell’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And chill’d had shrunk, should open forth like flowers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">After cold winds of night, when gentle gales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restore the genial sun? If all were known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would it indeed be not to be forgiven?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Thus would he lay the unction to his soul,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If all were truly known, as Heaven knows all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven that is merciful as well as just, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A passion slow and mutual in its growth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pure as fraternal love, long self-conceal’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when confess’d in silence, long controll’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Treacherous occasion, human frailty, fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of endless separation, worse than death, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The purpose and the hope with which the Fiend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tempted, deceived, and madden’d him; ... but then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As at a new temptation would he start,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shuddering beneath the intolerable shame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And clench in agony his matted hair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While in his soul the perilous thought arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How easy ’twere to plunge where yonder waves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Invited him to rest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Oh for a voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of comfort, ... for a ray of hope from Heaven!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hand that from these billows of despair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May reach and snatch him ere he sink engulph’d!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At length, as life when it hath lain long time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opprest beneath some grievous malady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seems to rouse up with re-collected strength,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sick man doth feel within himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A second spring; so Roderick’s better mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arose to save him. Lo! the western sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flames o’er the broad Atlantic; on the verge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of glowing ocean rests; retiring then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draws with it all its rays, and sudden night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fills the whole cope of heaven. The penitent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knelt by Romano’s grave, and falling prone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Claspt with extended arms the funeral mould.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father! he cried; Companion! only friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all beside was lost! thou too art gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the poor sinner whom from utter death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy providential hand preserved, once more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Totters upon the gulph. I am too weak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For solitude, ... too vile a wretch to bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This everlasting commune with myself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Tempter hath assail’d me; my own heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is leagued with him; Despair hath laid the nets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take my soul, and Memory, like a ghost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haunts me, and drives me to the toils. O Saint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While I was blest with thee, the hermitage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was my sure haven! Look upon me still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For from thy heavenly mansion thou canst see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The suppliant; look upon thy child in Christ.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is there no other way for penitence?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I ask not martyrdom; for what am I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I should pray for triumphs, the fit meed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of a long life of holy works like thine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or how should I presumptuously aspire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wear the heavenly crown resign’d by thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For my poor sinful sake? Oh point me thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some humblest, painfulest, severest path, ...</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some new austerity, unheard of yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Syrian fields of glory, or the sands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of holiest Egypt. Let me bind my brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thorns, and barefoot seek Jerusalem,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tracking the way with blood; there day by day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inflict upon this guilty flesh the scourge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drink vinegar and gall, and for my bed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hang with extended limbs upon the Cross,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A nightly crucifixion!... any thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of action, difficulty, bodily pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Labour, and outward suffering, ... any thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But stillness and this dreadful solitude!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Romano! Father! let me hear thy voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In dreams, O sainted Soul! or from the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speak to thy penitent; even from the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine were a voice of comfort.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">Thus he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Easing the pressure of his burthen’d heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With passionate prayer; thus pour’d his spirit forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till with the long impetuous effort spent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His spirit fail’d, and laying on the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His weary head as on a pillow, sleep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell on him. He had pray’d to hear a voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of consolation, and in dreams a voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of consolation came. Roderick, it said, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick, my poor, unhappy, sinful child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jesus have mercy on thee!... Not if Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had opened, and Romano, visible</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his beatitude, had breathed that prayer; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not if the grave had spoken, had it pierced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So deeply in his soul, nor wrung his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With such compunctious visitings, nor given</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">So quick, so keen a pang. It was that voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which sung his fretful infancy to sleep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So patiently; which soothed his childish griefs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Counsell’d, with anguish and prophetic tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His headstrong youth. And lo! his Mother stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before him in the vision; in those weeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which never from the hour when to the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She follow’d her dear lord Theodofred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rusilla laid aside; but in her face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sorrow that bespake a heavier load</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At heart, and more unmitigated woe, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, a more mortal wretchedness than when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Witiza’s ruffians and the red-hot brass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had done their work, and in her arms she held</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her eyeless husband; wiped away the sweat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which still his tortures forced from every pore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cool’d his scorch’d lids with medicinal herbs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pray’d the while for patience for herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And him, and pray’d for vengeance too, and found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Best comfort in her curses. In his dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Groaning he knelt before her to beseech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her blessing, and she raised her hands to lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A benediction on him. But those hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were chain’d, and casting a wild look around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thrilling voice she cried, Will no one break</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These shameful fetters? Pedro, Theudemir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Athanagild, where are ye? Roderick’s arm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is wither’d; ... Chiefs of Spain, but where are ye?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou, Pelayo, thou our surest hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dost thou too sleep?... Awake, Pelayo!... up!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why tarriest thou, Deliverer?... But with that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She broke her bonds, and lo! her form was changed!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Radiant in arms she stood! a bloody Cross</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gleam’d on her breast-plate, in her shield display’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Erect a lion ramp’d; her helmed head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose like the Berecynthian Goddess crown’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With towers, and in her dreadful hand the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Red as a fire-brand blazed. Anon the tramp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of horsemen, and the din of multitudes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moving to mortal conflict, rang around;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The battle-song, the clang of sword and shield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">War-cries and tumult, strife and hate and rage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blasphemous prayers, confusion, agony,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rout and pursuit and death; and over all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shout of victory ... Spain and Victory!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick, as the strong vision master’d him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rush’d to the fight rejoicing: starting then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As his own effort burst the charm of sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He found himself upon that lonely grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In moonlight and in silence. But the dream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wrought in him still; for still he felt his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pant, and his wither’d arm was trembling still;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And still that voice was in his ear which call’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Jesus for his sake.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Oh, might he hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That actual voice! and if Rusilla lived, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If shame and anguish for his crimes not yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had brought her to the grave, ... sure she would bless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her penitent child, and pour into his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prayers and forgiveness, which like precious balm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would heal the wounded soul. Nor to herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Less precious, or less healing, would the voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That spake forgiveness flow. She wept her son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For ever lost, cut off with all the weight</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of unrepented sin upon his head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sin which had weigh’d a nation down ... what joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To know that righteous Heaven had in its wrath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remember’d mercy, and she yet might meet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The child whom she had borne, redeem’d, in bliss.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sudden impulse of such thoughts confirm’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That unacknowledged purpose, which till now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vainly had sought its end. He girt his loins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laid holiest Mary’s image in a cleft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the rock, where, shelter’d from the elements,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It might abide till happier days came on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From all defilement safe; pour’d his last prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon Romano’s grave, and kiss’d the earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which cover’d his remains, and wept as if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At long leave-taking, then began his way.</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas now the earliest morning; soon the Sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rising above Albardos, pour’d his light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the forest, and with ray aslant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entering its depth, illumed the branchless pines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brighten’d their bark, tinged with a redder hue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its rusty stains, and cast along the floor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long lines of shadow, where they rose erect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like pillars of the temple. With slow foot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick pursued his way; for penitence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remorse which gave no respite, and the long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And painful conflict of his troubled soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had worn him down. Now brighter thoughts arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that triumphant vision floated still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before his sight with all her blazonry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her castled helm, and the victorious sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That flash’d like lightning o’er the field of blood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sustain’d by thoughts like these, from morn till eve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He journey’d, and drew near Leyria’s walls.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas even-song time, but not a bell was heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Instead thereof, on her polluted towers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bidding the Moors to their unhallow’d prayer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cryer stood, and with his sonorous voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fill’d the delicious vale where Lena winds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thro’ groves and pastoral meads. The sound, the sight</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of turban, girdle, robe, and scymitar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tawny skins, awoke contending thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of anger, shame, and anguish in the Goth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The face of human-kind so long unseen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Confused him now, and through the streets he went</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With haggëd mien, and countenance like one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crazed or bewilder’d. All who met him turn’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wonder’d as he pass’d. One stopt him short.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Put alms into his hand, and then desired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In broken Gothic speech, the moon-struck man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bless him. With a look of vacancy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick received the alms; his wandering eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell on the money, and the fallen King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeing his own royal impress on the piece,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Broke out into a quick convulsive voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That seem’d like laughter first, but ended soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In hollow groans supprest; the Musselman</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrunk at the ghastly sound, and magnified</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The name of Allah as he hasten’d on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Christian woman spinning at her door</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld him, and, with sudden pity touch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She laid her spindle by, and running in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took bread, and following after call’d him back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And placing in his passive hands the loaf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, Christ Jesus for his mother’s sake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have mercy on thee! With a look that seem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like idiotcy he heard her, and stood still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Staring awhile; then bursting into tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wept like a child, and thus relieved his heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full even to bursting else with swelling thoughts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So through the streets, and through the northern gate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did Roderick, reckless of a resting-place,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With feeble yet with hurried step pursue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His agitated way; and when he reach’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The open fields, and found himself alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath the starry canopy of Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sense of solitude, so dreadful late,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was then repose and comfort. There he stopt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside a little rill, and brake the loaf;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shedding o’er that long untasted food</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Painful but quiet tears, with grateful soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He breathed thanksgiving forth, then made his bed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On heath and myrtle.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">But when he arose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At day-break and pursued his way, his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Felt lighten’d that the shock of mingling first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among his fellow-kind was overpast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And journeying on, he greeted whom he met</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With such short interchange of benison</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As each to other gentle travellers give,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Recovering thus the power of social speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which he had long disused. When hunger prest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He ask’d for alms: slight supplication served;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A countenance so pale and woe-begone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moved all to pity; and the marks it bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rigorous penance and austerest life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With something too of majesty that still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Appear’d amid the wreck, inspired a sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of reverence too. The goat-herd on the hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open’d his scrip for him; the babe in arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Affrighted at his visage, turn’d away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And clinging to the mother’s neck in tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would yet again look up and then again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrink back, with cry renew’d. The bolder imps</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sporting beside the way, at his approach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brake off their games for wonder, and stood still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silence; some among them cried, A Saint!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The village matron when she gave him food</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Besought his prayers; and one entreated him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lay his healing hands upon her child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For with a sore and hopeless malady</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wasting, it long had lain, ... and sure, she said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was a man of God.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Thus travelling on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He past the vale where wild Arunca pours</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its wintry torrents; and the happier site</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of old Conimbrica, whose ruin’d towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bore record of the fierce Alani’s wrath.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mondego too he cross’d, not yet renown’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In poets’ amorous lay; and left behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The walls at whose foundation pious hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Priest and Monk and Bishop meekly toil’d, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So had the insulting Arian given command.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those stately palaces and rich domains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were now the Moor’s, and many a weary age</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must Coimbra wear the misbeliever’s yoke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before Fernando’s banner through her gate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall pass triumphant, and her hallow’d Mosque</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold the hero of Bivar receive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The knighthood which he glorified so oft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his victorious fields. Oh if the years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To come might then have risen on Roderick’s soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How had they kindled and consoled his heart!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What joy might Douro’s haven then have given,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence Portugal, the faithful and the brave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall take her name illustrious!... what, those walls</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Mumadona one day will erect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Convent and town and towers, which shall become</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cradle of that famous monarchy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What joy might these prophetic scenes have given, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What ample vengeance on the Musselman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Driven out with foul defeat, and made to feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Africa the wrongs he wrought to Spain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And still pursued by that relentless sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even to the farthest Orient, where his power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received its mortal wound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">O years of pride!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In undiscoverable futurity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet unevolved, your destined glories lay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all that Roderick in these fated scenes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld, was grief and wretchedness, ... the waste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of recent war, and that more mournful calm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of joyless, helpless, hopeless servitude.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas not the ruin’d walls of church or tower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cottage or hall or convent, black with smoke;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas not the unburied bones, which where the dogs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And crows had strewn them, lay amid the field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bleaching in sun or shower, that wrung his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With keenest anguish: ’twas when he beheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The turban’d traitor shew his shameless front</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the open eye of Heaven, ... the renegade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On whose base brutal nature unredeem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even black apostacy itself could stamp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No deeper reprobation, at the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assign’d fall prostrate; and unite the names</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of God and the Blasphemer, ... impious prayer, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most impious, when from unbelieving lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The accursëd utterance came. Then Roderick’s heart</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With indignation burnt, and then he long’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be a King again, that so, for Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Betray’d and his Redeemer thus renounced,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He might inflict due punishment, and make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These wretches feel his wrath. But when he saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The daughters of the land, ... who, as they went</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With cheerful step to church, were wont to shew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their innocent faces to all passers eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Freely, and free from sin as when they look’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In adoration and in praise to Heaven, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now mask’d in Moorish mufflers, to the Mosque</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Holding uncompanied their jealous way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His spirit seem’d at that unhappy sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To die away within him, and he too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would fain have died, so death could bring with it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entire oblivion.</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Rent with thoughts like these,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He reach’d that city, once the seat renown’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Suevi kings, where, in contempt of Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Degenerate long, the North’s heroic race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raised first a rival throne; now from its state</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of proud regality debased and fallen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still bounteous nature o’er the lovely vale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where like a Queen rose Bracara august,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour’d forth her gifts profuse; perennial springs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flow’d for her habitants, and genial suns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With kindly showers to bless the happy clime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Combined in vain their gentle influences:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For patient servitude was there, who bow’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His neck beneath the Moor, and silent grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That eats into the soul. The walls and stones</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seem’d to reproach their dwellers; stately piles</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet undecay’d, the mighty monuments</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Roman pomp, Barbaric palaces,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Gothic halls, where haughty Barons late</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gladden’d their faithful vassals with the feast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And flowing bowl, alike the spoiler’s now.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Leaving these captive scenes behind, he crost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cavado’s silver current, and the banks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Lima, through whose groves in after years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mournful yet sweet, Diogo’s amorous lute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prolong’d its tuneful echoes. But when now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beyond Arnoya’s tributary tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He came where Minho roll’d its ampler stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Auria’s ancient walls, fresh horrors met</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His startled view; for prostrate in the dust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those walls were laid, and towers and temples stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tottering in frightful ruins, as the flame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had left them black and bare; and through the streets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All with the recent wreck of war bestrewn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Helmet and turban, scymitar and sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christian and Moor in death promiscuous lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each where they fell; and blood-flakes, parch’d and crack’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the dry slime of some receding flood;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And half-burnt bodies, which allured from far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wolf and raven, and to impious food</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tempted the houseless dog.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">A thrilling pang,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sweat like death, a sickness of the soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came over Roderick. Soon they pass’d away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And admiration in their stead arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stern joy, and inextinguishable hope,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With wrath, and hate, and sacred vengeance now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indissolubly link’d. O valiant race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O people excellently brave, he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">True Goths ye fell, and faithful to the last;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though overpower’d, triumphant, and in death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unconquer’d! Holy be your memory!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bless’d and glorious now and evermore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be your heroic names!... Led by the sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As thus he cried aloud, a woman came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward him from the ruins. For the love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Christ, she said, lend me a little while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy charitable help!... Her words, her voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her look, more horror to his heart convey’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than all the havoc round: for though she spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the calm utterance of despair, in tones</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep-breathed and low, yet never sweeter voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour’d forth its hymns in ecstasy to Heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her hands were bloody, and her garments stain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With blood, her face with blood and dust defiled.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beauty and youth, and grace and majesty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had every charm of form and feature given;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But now upon her rigid countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Severest anguish set a fixedness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ghastlier than death.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">She led him through the streets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little way along, where four low walls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heapt rudely from the ruins round, enclosed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A narrow space: and there upon the ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Four bodies, decently composed, were laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though horrid all with wounds and clotted gore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A venerable ancient, by his side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A comely matron, for whose middle age,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">(If ruthless slaughter had not intervened,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nature it seem’d, and gentle Time, might well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have many a calm declining year in store;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The third an armëd warrior, on his breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An infant, over whom his arms were cross’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There, ... with firm eye and steady countenance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unfaltering, she addrest him, ... there they lie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Child, Husband, Parents, ... Adosinda’s all!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could not break the earth with these poor hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor other tomb provide, ... but let that pass!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Auria itself is now but one wide tomb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For all its habitants:—What better grave?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What worthier monument?... Oh cover not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their blood, thou Earth! and ye, ye blessëd Souls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Heroes and of murder’d Innocents,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh never let your everlasting cries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cease round the Eternal Throne, till the Most High</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For all these unexampled wrongs hath given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full, ... overflowing vengeance!</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">While she spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She raised her lofty hands to Heaven, as if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calling for justice on the Judgement-seat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then laid them on her eyes, and leaning on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bent o’er the open sepulchre.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">But soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With quiet mien collectedly, like one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who from intense devotion, and the act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of ardent prayer, arising, girds himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For this world’s daily business, ... she arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And said to Roderick, Help me now to raise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The covering of the tomb.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">With half-burnt planks</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which she had gather’d for this funeral use</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They roof’d the vault, then laying stones above</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They closed it down; last, rendering all secure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stones upon stones they piled, till all appear’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A huge and shapeless heap. Enough, she cried;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And taking Roderick’s hands in both her own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wringing them with fervent thankfulness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May God shew mercy to thee, she exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When most thou needest mercy! Who thou art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know not; not of Auria, ... for of all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her sons and daughters, save the one who stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before thee, not a soul is left alive.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But thou hast render’d to me, in my hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of need, the only help which man could give.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What else of consolation may be found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For one so utterly bereft, from Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from myself must come. For deem not thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I shall sink beneath calamity:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This visitation, like a lightning-stroke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath scathed the fruit and blossom of my youth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One hour hath orphan’d me, and widow’d me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And made me childless. In this sepulchre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lie buried all my earthward hopes and fears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All human loves and natural charities; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All womanly tenderness, all gentle thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All female weakness too, I bury here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, all my former nature. There remain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Revenge and death: ... the bitterness of death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is past, and Heaven already hath vouchsafed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A foretaste of revenge.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Look here! she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And drawing back, held forth her bloody hands, ...</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis Moorish!... In the day of massacre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A captain of Alcahman’s murderous host</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reserved me from the slaughter. Not because</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My rank and station tempted him with thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of ransom, for amid the general waste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of ruin all was lost; ... Nor yet, be sure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That pity moved him, ... they who from this race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Accurst for pity look, such pity find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As ravenous wolves shew the defenceless flock.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My husband at my feet had fallen; my babe, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spare me that thought, O God!... and then ... even then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the maddening throes of agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which rent my soul, ... when if this solid Earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had open’d and let out the central fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before whose all-involving flames wide Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall shrivel like a scroll and be consumed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The universal wreck had been to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Relief and comfort; ... even then this Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn’d on me his libidinous eyes, and bade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His men reserve me safely for an hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of dalliance, ... me!... me in my agonies!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when I found for what this miscreant child</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Hell had snatch’d me from the butchery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The very horror of that monstrous thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saved me from madness; I was calm at once, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet comforted and reconciled to life:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hatred became to me the life of life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its purpose and its power.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">The glutted Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At length broke up. This hell-dog turn’d aside</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward his home: we travell’d fast and far,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till by a forest edge at eve he pitched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His tents. I wash’d and ate at his command,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forcing revolted nature; I composed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My garments and bound up my scatter’d hair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when he took my hand, and to his couch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would fain have drawn me, gently I retired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From that abominable touch, and said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forbear to-night I pray thee, for this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A widow, as thou seest me, am I made;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore, according to our law, must watch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pray to-night. The loathsome villain paused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere he assented, then laid down to rest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While at the door of the pavilion, I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knelt on the ground, and bowed my face to earth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when the neighbouring tents had ceased their stir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fires were out, and all were fast asleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I arose. The blessed Moon from Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lent me her holy light. I did not pray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For strength, for strength was given me as I drew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scymitar, and, standing o’er his couch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raised it in both my hands with steady aim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And smote his neck. Upward, as from a spring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When newly open’d by the husbandman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The villain’s life-blood spouted. Twice I struck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So making vengeance sure; then, praising God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retired amid the wood, and measured back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My patient way to Auria, to perform</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This duty which thou seest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">As thus she spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick intently listening had forgot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His crown, his kingdom, his calamities,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His crimes, ... so like a spell upon the Goth</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her powerful words prevail’d. With open lips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And eager ear, and eyes which, while they watch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her features, caught the spirit that she breathed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mute and enrapt he stood, and motionless;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vision rose before him; and that shout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, like a thunder-peal, victorious Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sent through the welkin, rung within his soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its deep prophetic echoes. On his brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pride and power of former majesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dawn’d once again, but changed and purified:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Duty and high heroic purposes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now hallow’d it, and as with inward light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illumed his meagre countenance austere.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Awhile in silence Adosinda stood,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">My tale hath moved thee! it might move the dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quicken captivity’s dead soul, and rouse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This prostrate country from her mortal trance:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore I live to tell it; and for this</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Nor yet between sepulchral walls immured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alive to penitence alone; my rule</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A passion in this woman’s breast, wherein</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All passions and all virtues are combined;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And hope, and natural piety, and faith,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of God, it came and saved me; and in it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spain must have her salvation. In thy hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, on the grave of all my family,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I make my vow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">She said, and kneeling down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Placed within Roderick’s palms her folded hands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This life, she cried, I dedicate to God,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus long had Roderick heard her powerful words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silence, awed before her; but his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was fill’d the while with swelling sympathy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now with impulse not to be restrain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The feeling overpower’d him. Hear me too,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">She must efface her stains of mortal sin,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">So saying, Adosinda left the King</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alone amid the ruins. There he stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As when Elisha, on the farther bank</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Jordan, saw that elder prophet mount</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And as the immortal Tishbite left behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His mantle and prophetic power, even so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had her inspiring presence left infused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spirit which she breathed. Gazing he stood,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Vouchsafed in mercy to himself and Spain;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the heroic mourner from his sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had pass’d away, still reverential awe</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Up murmuring Lona, he began toward</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sil’s ample stream he crost, where through the vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Orras, from that sacred land it bears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The whole collected waters; northward then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Skirting the heights of Aguiar, he reach’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That consecrated pile amid the wild,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which sainted Fructuoso in his zeal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rear’d to St. Felix, on Visonia’s banks.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">In commune with a priest of age mature,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose thoughtful visage and majestic mien</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bespake authority and weight of care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Odoar, the venerable Abbot, sate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When ushering Roderick in, the Porter said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A stranger came from Auria, and required</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Nay, answer’d Roderick, but thou hast not heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My tale. Where that devoted city lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In ashes, mid the ruins and the dead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I found a woman, whom the Moors had borne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Captive away; but she, by Heaven inspired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her good heart, with her own arm had wrought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her own deliverance, smiting in his tent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lustful Moorish miscreant, as of yore</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Judith’s holy deed the Assyrian fell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that same spirit which had strengthen’d her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Work’d in her still. Four walls with patient toil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She rear’d, wherein, as in a sepulchre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With her own hands she laid her murder’d babe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her husband and her parents, side by side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when we cover’d in this shapeless tomb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There on the grave of all her family,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did this courageous mourner dedicate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All thoughts and actions of her future life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To her poor country. For she said, that Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Supporting her, in mercy had vouchsafed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A foretaste of revenge; that, like the grace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of God, revenge had saved her; that in it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spain must have her salvation; and henceforth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That passion, thus sublimed and sanctified,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must be to all the loyal sons of Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pole-star of their faith, their rule and rite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observances and worthiest sacrifice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I took the vow, unworthy as I am,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her first sworn follower in the appointed rule;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then we parted; she among the hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rouse the vassals of her father’s house:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I at her bidding hitherward, to ask</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy counsel, who of our old Baronage</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">In act of pious passion raised to Heaven, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh none but Adosinda!... none but she, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None but that noble heart, which was the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Auria while it stood, its life and strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More than her father’s presence, or the arm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of her brave husband, valiant as he was.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hers was the spirit which inspired old age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ambitious boyhood, girls in timid youth,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And youthful mothers, doting like herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With ever-anxious love: She breathed through all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That zeal and that devoted faithfulness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which to the invader’s threats and promises</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn’d a deaf ear alike; which in the head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And flood of prosperous fortune check’d his course,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repell’d him from the walls, and when at length</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His overpowering numbers forced their way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even in that uttermost extremity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unyielding, still from street to street, from house</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To house, from floor to floor, maintain’d the fight:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till by their altars falling, in their doors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on their household hearths, and by their beds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cradles, and their fathers’ sepulchres,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This noble army, gloriously revenged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embraced their martyrdom. Heroic souls!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well have ye done, and righteously discharged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your arduous part! Your service is perform’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your earthly warfare done! Ye have put on</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ye have received your crown! Ye bear the palm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the throne of Grace!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">With that he paused,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Checking the strong emotions of his soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then with a solemn tone addressing him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who shared his secret thoughts, thou knowest, he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Urban, that they have not fallen in vain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For by this virtuous sacrifice they thinn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alcahman’s thousands; and his broken force,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exhausted by their dear-bought victory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn’d back from Auria, leaving us to breathe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among our mountains yet. We lack not here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good hearts, nor valiant hands. What walls or towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or battlements are like these fastnesses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These rocks and glens and everlasting hills?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give but that Aurian spirit, and the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will spend their force as idly on these holds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As round the rocky girdle of the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wild Cantabrian billows waste their rage.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give but that spirit!... Heaven hath given it us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If Adosinda thus, as from the dead,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Roderick replied, I am a sinful man,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A life mis-spent; but never bound by vows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till Adosinda taught me where to find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comfort, and how to work forgiveness out.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When that exalted woman took my vow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She call’d me Maccabee; from this day forth</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be that my earthly name. But tell me now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom shall we rouse to take upon his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crown of Spain? Where are the Gothic Chiefs?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sacaru, Theudemir, Athanagild,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All who survived that eight days’ obstinate fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When clogg’d with bodies Chrysus scarce could for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its bloody stream along? Witiza’s sons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bad offspring of a stock accurst, I know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have put the turban on their recreant heads.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where are your own Cantabrian Lords? I ween,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eudon, and Pedro, and Pelayo now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have ceased their rivalry. If Pelayo live,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His were the worthy heart and rightful hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wield the sceptre and the sword of Spain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Odoar and Urban eyed him while he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if they wonder’d whose the tongue might be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Familiar thus with Chiefs and thoughts of state.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They scann’d his countenance, but not a trace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Betray’d the Royal Goth: sunk was that eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sovereignty, and on the emaciate cheek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had penitence and anguish deeply drawn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their furrows premature, ... forestalling time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shedding upon thirty’s brow more snows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than threescore winters in their natural course</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might else have sprinkled there. It seems indeed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thou hast pass’d thy days in solitude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied the Abbot, or thou would’st not ask</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of things so long gone by. Athanagild</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Theudemir have taken on their necks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The yoke. Sacaru play’d a nobler part.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long within Merida did he withstand</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The invader’s hot assault; and when at length,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hopeless of all relief, he yielded up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gates, disdaining in his father’s land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To breathe the air of bondage, with a few</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Found faithful till the last, indignantly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did he toward the ocean bend his way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shaking from his feet the dust of Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took ship, and hoisted sail through seas unknown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To seek for freedom. Our Cantabrian Chiefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All have submitted, but the wary Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trusteth not all alike: At his own Court</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He holds Pelayo, as suspecting most</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That calm and manly spirit; Pedro’s son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There too is held as hostage, and secures</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His father’s faith; Count Eudon is despised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so lives unmolested. When he pays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His tribute, an uncomfortable thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May then perhaps disturb him: ... or more like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He meditates how profitable ’twere</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be a Moor; and if apostacy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were all, and to be unbaptized might serve, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I waste breath upon a wretch like this;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo is the only hope of Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only Pelayo.</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">If, as we believe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Urban then, the hand of Heaven is here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dreadful though they be, yet for wise end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of good, these visitations do its work;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dimly as our mortal sight may scan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The future, yet methinks my soul descries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How in Pelayo should the purposes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Heaven be best accomplish’d. All too long,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here in their own inheritance, the sons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Spain have groan’d beneath a foreign yoke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Punic and Roman, Kelt, and Goth, and Greek:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This latter tempest comes to sweep away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All proud distinctions which commingling blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And time’s long course have fail’d to efface; and now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perchance it is the will of Fate to rear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the soil of Spain a Spanish throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restoring in Pelayo’s native line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sceptre to the Spaniard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Go thou, then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And seek Pelayo at the Conqueror’s court.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell him the mountaineers are unsubdued;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The precious time they needed hath been gain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Auria’s sacrifice, and all they ask</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is him to guide them on. In Odoar’s name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Urban’s, tell him that the hour is come.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Then pausing for a moment, he pursued:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rule which thou hast taken on thyself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toledo ratifies: ’tis meet for Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as the will divine, to be received,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observed, and spread abroad. Come hither thou,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who for thyself hath chosen the good part;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me lay hands on thee, and consecrate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy life unto the Lord.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Me! Roderick cried;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Me? sinner that I am!... and while he spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wither’d cheek grew paler, and his limbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shook. As thou goest among the infidels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pursued the Primate, many thou wilt find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fallen from the faith; by weakness some betray’d,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some led astray by baser hope of gain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And haply too by ill example led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of those in whom they trusted. Yet have these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their lonely hours, when sorrow, or the touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sickness, and that aweful power divine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which hath its dwelling in the heart of man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life of his soul, his monitor and judge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Move them with silent impulse; but they look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For help, and finding none to succour them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The irrevocable moment passeth by.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore, my brother, in the name of Christ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus I lay hands on thee, that in His name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou with His gracious promises may’st raise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fallen, and comfort those that are in need,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bring salvation to the penitent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, brother, go thy way: the peace of God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be with thee, and his blessing prosper us!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And many a mountain range hath Roderick cross’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a lovely vale, ere he beheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Betis, winding through the unbounded plain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roll’d his majestic waters. There at eve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entering an inn, he took his humble seat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With other travellers round the crackling hearth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where heath and cistus gave their flagrant flame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That flame no longer, as in other times,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lit up the countenance of easy mirth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And light discourse: the talk which now went round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was of the grief that press’d on every heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Spain subdued; the sceptre of the Goths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Broken; their nation and their name effaced;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slaughter and mourning, which had left no house</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unvisited; and shame, which set its mark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On every Spaniard’s face. One who had seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His sons fall bravely at his side, bewail’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unhappy chance which, rescuing him from death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Left him the last of all his family;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet he rejoiced to think that none who drew</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their blood from him remain’d to wear the yoke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be at the miscreant’s beck, and propagate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A breed of slaves to serve them. Here sate one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who told of fair possessions lost, and babes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To goodly fortunes born, of all bereft.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Another for a virgin daughter mourn’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lewd barbarian’s spoil. A fourth had seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His only child forsake him in his age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for a Moor renounce her hope in Christ.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His was the heaviest grief of all, he said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And clenching as he spake his hoary locks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He cursed King Roderick’s soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">Oh curse him not!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick exclaim’d, all shuddering as he spake.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, for the love of Jesus, curse him not!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sufficient is the dreadful load of guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That lies upon his miserable soul!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O brother, do not curse that sinful soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which Jesus suffer’d on the cross to save!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">But then an old man, who had sate thus long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A silent listener, from his seat arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And moving round to Roderick took his hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Christ bless thee, brother, for that Christian speech,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said; and shame on me that any tongue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Readier than mine was found to utter it!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His own emotion fill’d him while he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So that he did not feel how Roderick’s hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shook like a palsied limb; and none could see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How, at his well-known voice, the countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that poor traveller suddenly was changed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sunk with deadlier paleness; for the flame</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was spent, and from behind him, on the wall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High hung, the lamp with feeble glimmering play’d.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh it is ever thus! the old man pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crimes and woes of universal Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are charged on him; and curses which should aim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At living heads, pursue beyond the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His poor unhappy soul! As if his sin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had wrought the fall of our old monarchy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if the Musselmen in their career</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would ne’er have overleapt the gulf which parts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iberia from the Mauritanian shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If Julian had not beckon’d them!... Alas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The evils which drew on our overthrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would soon by other means have wrought their end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though Julian’s daughter should have lived and died</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A virgin vow’d and veil’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Touch not on that,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrinking with inward shiverings at the thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The penitent exclaim’d. Oh, if thou lovest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soul of Roderick, touch not on that deed!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God in his mercy may forgive it him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But human tongue must never speak his name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without reproach and utter infamy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For that abhorred act. Even thou.... But here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Siverian taking up the word, brake off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unwittingly the incautious speech. Even I,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quoth he, who nursed him in his father’s hall, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even I can only for that deed of shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Offer in agony my secret prayers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Spain hath witness’d other crimes as foul:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have we not seen Favila’s shameless wife.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Throned in Witiza’s ivory car, parade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our towns with regal pageantry, and bid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The murderous tyrant in her husband’s blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dip his adulterous hand? Did we not see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo, by that bloody king’s pursuit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that unnatural mother, from the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With open outcry, like an outlaw’d thief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hunted? And saw ye not Theodofred,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As through the streets I guided his dark steps,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roll mournfully toward the noon-day sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His blank and senseless eye-balls? Spain saw this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And suffer’d it!... I seek not to excuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sin of Roderick. Jesu, who beholds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The burning tears I shed in solitude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knows how I plead for him in midnight prayer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if, when he victoriously revenged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wrongs of Chindasuintho’s house, his sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had not for mercy turn’d aside its edge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh what a day of glory had there been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the banks of Chrysus! Curse not him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who in that fatal conflict to the last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So valiantly maintain’d his country’s cause;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if your sorrow needs must have its vent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In curses, let your imprecations strike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The caitiffs, who, when Roderick’s hornëd helm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose eminent amid the thickest fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Betraying him who spared and trusted them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forsook their King, their Country, and their God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gave the Moor his conquest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">Aye! they said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These were Witiza’s hateful progeny;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in an evil hour the unhappy King</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had spared the viperous brood. With that they talk’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How Sisibert and Ebba through the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Guided the foe: and Orpas, who had cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mitre from his renegado brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went with the armies of the infidels;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how in Hispalis, even where his hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had minister’d so oft the bread of life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The circumcised apostate did not shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To shew in open day his turban’d head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Queen too, Egilona, one exclaim’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was she not married to the enemy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moor, the Misbeliever? What a heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were hers, that she could pride and plume herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rank among his herd of concubines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Having been what she had been! And who could say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How far domestic wrongs and discontent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had wrought upon the King!... Hereat the old man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raising beneath the knit and curly brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His mournful eyes, replied, This I can tell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That that unquiet spirit and unblest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though Roderick never told his sorrows, drove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rusilla from the palace of her son.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She could not bear to see his generous mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wither beneath the unwholesome influence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cankering at the core. And I know well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That oft when she deplored his barren bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thought of Egilona’s qualities</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came like a bitter medicine for her grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the extinction of her husband’s line,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sad consolation, reconciled her heart.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">But Roderick, while they communed thus, had ceased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hear, such painfulest anxiety</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sight of that old venerable man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awoke. A sickening fear came over him:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hope which led him from his hermitage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now seem’d for ever gone, for well he knew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nothing but death could break the ties which bound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That faithful servant to his father’s house.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She then for whose forgiveness he had yearn’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who in her blessing would have given and found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The peace of Heaven, ... she then was to the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gone down disconsolate at last; in this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all the woes of her unhappy life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unhappiest, that she did not live to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God had vouchsafed repentance to her child.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But then a hope arose that yet she lived;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The weighty cause which led Siverian here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might draw him from her side; better to know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The worst than fear it. And with that he bent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over the embers, and with head half raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aslant, and shadow’d by his hand, he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where is King Roderick’s mother? lives she still?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">God hath upheld her, the old man replied;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bears this last and heaviest of her griefs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not as she bore her husband’s wrongs, when hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her indignant heart supported her;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But patiently, like one who finds from Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A comfort which the world can neither give</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor take away.... Roderick inquired no more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He breathed a silent prayer in gratitude,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then wrapt his cloak around him, and lay down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where he might weep unseen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">When morning came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earliest of all the travellers he went forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And linger’d for Siverian by the way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside a fountain, where the constant fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of water its perpetual gurgling made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the wayfaring or the musing man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweetest of all sweet sounds. The Christian hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose general charity for man and beast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Built it in better times, had with a cross</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of well-hewn stone crested the pious work,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which now the misbelievers had cast down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And broken in the dust it lay defiled.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick beheld it lying at his feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gathering reverently the fragments up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Placed them within the cistern, and restored</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With careful collocation its dear form, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So might the waters, like a crystal shrine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Preserve it from pollution. Kneeling then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er the memorial of redeeming love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bent, and mingled with the fount his tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pour’d his spirit to the Crucified.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">A Moor came by, and seeing him, exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, Kaffer! worshipper of wood and stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God’s curse confound thee! And as Roderick turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His face, the miscreant spurn’d him with his foot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Between the eyes. The indignant King arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fell’d him to the ground. But then the Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drew forth his dagger, rising as he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What, darëst thou, thou infidel and slave,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strike a believer? and he aim’d a blow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At Roderick’s breast. But Roderick caught his arm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And closed, and wrench’d the dagger from his hold, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such timely strength did those emaciate limbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From indignation draw, ... and in his neck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With mortal stroke he drove the avenging steel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hilt deep. Then, as the thirsty sand drank in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The expiring miscreant’s blood, he look’d around</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In sudden apprehension, lest the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had seen them; but Siverian was in sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The only traveller, and he smote his mule</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hasten’d up. Ah, brother! said the old man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine is a spirit of the ancient mould!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And would to God a thousand men like thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had fought at Roderick’s side on that last day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When treason overpower’d him! Now, alas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A manly Gothic heart doth ill accord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With these unhappy times. Come, let us hide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This carrion, while the favouring hour permits.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">So saying he alighted. Soon they scoop’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid loose-lying sand a hasty grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And levell’d over it the easy soil.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father, said Roderick, as they journey’d on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let this thing be a seal and sacrament</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of truth between us: Wherefore should there be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Concealment between two right Gothic hearts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In evil days like ours? What thou hast seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is but the first fruit of the sacrifice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which on this injured and polluted soil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As on a bloody altar, I have sworn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To offer to insulted Heaven for Spain,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her vengeance and her expiation. This</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was but a hasty act, by sudden wrong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Provoked: but I am bound for Cordoba,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On weighty mission from Visonia sent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To breathe into Pelayo’s ear a voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of spirit-stirring power, which like the trump</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the Arch-angel, shall awake dead Spain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The northern mountaineers are unsubdued;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They call upon Pelayo for their chief;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Odoar and Urban tell him that the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is come. Thou too, I ween, old man, art charged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With no light errand, or thou wouldst not now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have left the ruins of thy master’s house.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Who art thou? cried Siverian, as he search’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wan and wither’d features of the King.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The face is of a stranger, but thy voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disturbs me like a dream.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Roderick replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou seest me as I am, ... a stranger; one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose fortunes in the general wreck were lost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His name and lineage utterly extinct,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Himself in mercy spared, surviving all; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mercy, that the bitter cup might heal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A soul diseased. Now, having cast the slough</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of old offences, thou beholdest me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A man new-born; in second baptism named,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like those who in Judea bravely raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against the Heathèn’s impious tyranny</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The banner of Jehovah, Maccabee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So call me. In that name hath Urban laid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His consecrating hands upon my head;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in that name have I myself for Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Devoted. Tell me now why thou art sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Cordoba; for sure thou goëst not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An idle gazer to the Conqueror’s court.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">She to the circumcised and upstart slave,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The Lady Gaudiosa sees in this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the quick foresight of maternal care,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Will seek the extinction of Pelayo’s line.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This too my venerable Mistress sees;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore these valiant and high-minded dames</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Send me to Cordoba; that if the Prince</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The goodly summit of that ancient tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Struck by Heaven’s bolt, seeks shelter now beneath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The only branch of its majestic stem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That still survives the storm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">Thus they pursued</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their journey, each from other gathering store</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For thought, with many a silent interval</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of mournful meditation, till they saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The temples and the towers of Cordoba</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shining majestic in the light of eve.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before them Betis roll’d his glittering stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In many a silvery winding traced afar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the ample plain. Behind the walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stately piles which crown’d its margin, rich</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With olives, and with sunny slope of vines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a lovely hamlet interspersed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose citron bowers were once the abode of peace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Height above height, receding hills were seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imbued with evening hues; and over all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The summits of the dark sierra rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lifting their heads amid the silent sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The traveller who with a heart at ease</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had seen the goodly vision, would have loved</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To linger, seeking with insatiate sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To treasure up its image, deep impress’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A joy for years to come. O Cordoba,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exclaim’d the old man, how princely are thy towers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How fair thy vales, thy hills how beautiful!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun who sheds on thee his parting smiles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sees not in all his wide career a scene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lovelier, nor more exuberantly blest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By bounteous earth and heaven. The very gales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Eden waft not from the immortal bowers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Odours to sense more exquisite, than these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, breathing from thy groves and gardens, now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Recall in me such thoughts of bitterness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The time has been when happy was their lot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who had their birthright here; but happy now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are they who to thy bosom are gone home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because they feel not in their graves the feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That trample upon Spain. ’Tis well that age</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath made me like a child, that I can weep:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My heart would else have broken, overcharged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I, false servant, should lie down to rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before my work is done.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Hard by their path,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little way without the walls, there stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An edifice, whereto, as by a spell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Siverian’s heart was drawn. Brother, quoth he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis like the urgency of our return</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will brook of no retardment; and this spot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It were a sin if I should pass, and leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unvisited. Beseech you turn with me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The while I offer up one duteous prayer.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Roderick made no reply. He had not dared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To turn his face toward those walls; but now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He follow’d where the old man led the way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lord! in his heart the silent sufferer said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgive my feeble soul, which would have shrunk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From this, ... for what am I that I should put</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bitter cup aside! O let my shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And anguish be accepted in thy sight!</div>

RODERICK IN TIMES PAST.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The mansion whitherward they went, was one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which in his youth Theodofred had built:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thither had he brought home in happy hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His blooming bride; there fondled on his knee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lovely boy she bore him. Close beside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A temple to that Saint he rear’d, who first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As old tradition tells, proclaim’d to Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gospel-tidings; and in health and youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There mindful of mortality, he saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His sepulchre prepared. Witiza took</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his adulterous leman and himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The stately pile: but to that sepulchre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When from captivity and darkness death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enlarged him, was Theodofred consign’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For that unhappy woman, wasting then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath a mortal malady, at heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was smitten, and the Tyrant at her prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This poor and tardy restitution made.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon the repentant sinner follow’d him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And calling on Pelayo ere she died,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his own wrongs, and for his father’s death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Implored forgiveness of her absent child, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If it were possible he could forgive</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crimes black as her’s, she said. And by the pangs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of her remorse, ... by her last agonies, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unutterable horrors of her death, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by the blood of Jesus on the cross</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For sinners given, did she beseech his prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In aid of her most miserable soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus mingling sudden shrieks with hopeless vows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And uttering franticly Pelayo’s name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And crying out for mercy in despair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here had she made her dreadful end, and here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her wretched body was deposited.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That presence seem’d to desecrate the place:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thenceforth the usurper shunn’d it with the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of conscious guilt; nor could Rusilla bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These groves and bowers, which, like funereal shades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opprest her with their monumental forms:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One day of bitter and severe delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Roderick came for vengeance, she endured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then for ever left her bridal halls.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh when I last beheld yon princely pile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exclaim’d Siverian, with what other thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full, and elate of spirit, did I pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its joyous gates! The weedery which through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The interstices of those neglected courts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uncheck’d had flourish’d long, and seeded there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was trampled then and bruised beneath the feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of thronging crowds. Here drawn in fair array,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The faithful vassals of my master’s house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their javelins sparkling to the morning sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spread their triumphant banners; high-plumed helms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose o’er the martial ranks, and prancing steeds</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made answer to the trumpet’s stirring voice;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While yonder towers shook the dull silence off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which long to their deserted walls had clung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with redoubling echoes swell’d the shout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hail’d victorious Roderick. Louder rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The acclamation, when the dust was seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rising beneath his chariot-wheels far off;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But nearer as the youthful hero came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All sounds of all the multitude were hush’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from the thousands and ten thousands here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom Cordoba and Hispalis sent forth, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea whom all Bætica, all Spain pour’d out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To greet his triumph, ... not a whisper rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Heaven, such awe and reverence master’d them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such expectation held them motionless.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conqueror and King he came; but with no joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of conquest, and no pride of sovereignty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That day display’d; for at his father’s grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did Roderick come to offer up his vow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of vengeance well perform’d. Three coal-black steed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drew on his ivory chariot: by his side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still wrapt in mourning for the long-deceased,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rusilla state; a deeper paleness blanch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her faded countenance, but in her eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The light of her majestic nature shone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bound, and expecting at their hands the death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So well deserved, Witiza follow’d them;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aghast and trembling, first he gazed around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wildly from side to side; then from the face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of universal execration shrunk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hanging his wretched head abased; and poor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of spirit, with unmanly tears deplored</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">His fortune, not his crimes. With bolder front,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Confiding in his priestly character,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came Orpas next; and then the spurious race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom in unhappy hour Favila’s wife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought forth for Spain. O mercy ill bestow’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Roderick, in compassion for their youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for Pelayo’s sake, forebore to crush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The brood of vipers!</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Err perchance he might,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied the Goth, suppressing as he spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All outward signs of pain, though every word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went like a dagger to his bleeding heart; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But sure, I ween, that error is not placed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among his sins. Old man, thou mayest regret</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mercy ill deserved, and worse return’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But not for this wouldst thou reproach the King!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Reproach him? cried Siverian; ... I reproach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My child, ... my noble boy, ... whom every tongue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bless’d at that hour, ... whose love fill’d every heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With joy, and every eye with joyful tears!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My brave, my beautiful, my generous boy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brave, beautiful, and generous as he was,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Never so brave, so beautiful, so great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As then, ... not even on that glorious day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When on the field of victory, elevate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the thousands who acclaim’d him King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firm on the shield above their heads upraised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Erect he stood, and waved his bloody sword....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why dost thou shake thy head as if in doubt?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I do not dream, nor fable! Ten short years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have scarcely past away, since all within</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Pyrenean hills, and the three seas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which girdle Spain, echoed in one response</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The acclamation from that field of fight....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or doth aught ail thee, that thy body quakes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shudders thus?</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">’Tis but a chill, replied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The King, in passing from the open air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under the shadow of this thick-set grove.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh! if this scene awoke in thee such thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As swell my bosom here, the old man pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sunshine, or shade, and all things from without,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would be alike indifferent. Gracious God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only but ten short years, ... and all so changed!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ten little years since in yon court he check’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His fiery steeds. The steeds obey’d his hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The whirling wheels stood still, and when he leapt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the pavement, the whole people heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In their deep silence, open-ear’d, the sound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With slower movement from the ivory seat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rusilla rose, her arm, as down she stept,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Extended to her son’s supporting hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not for default of firm or agile strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But that the feeling of that solemn hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Subdued her then, and tears bedimm’d her sight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howbeit when to her husband’s grave she came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the sepulchral stone she bow’d her head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awhile; then rose collectedly, and fix’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the scene her calm and steady eye.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick, ... oh when did valour wear a form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So beautiful, so noble, so august?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or vengeance, when did it put on before</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A character so aweful, so divine?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick stood up, and reaching to the tomb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hands, my hero cried, Theodofred!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father! I stand before thee once again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">According to thy prayer, when kneeling down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Between thy knees I took my last farewell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And vow’d by all thy sufferings, all thy wrongs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by my mother’s days and nights of woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her silent anguish, and the grief which then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even from thee she did not seek to hide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That if our cruel parting should avail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To save me from the Tyrant’s jealous guilt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surely should my avenging sword fulfil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whate’er he omen’d. Oh that time, I cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would give the strength of manhood to this arm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Already would it find a manly heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guide it to its purpose! And I swore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Never again to see my father’s face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor ask my mother’s blessing, till I brought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dead or in chains, the Tyrant to thy feet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boy as I was, before all Saints in Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And highest God, whose justice slumbereth not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I made the vow. According to thy prayer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In all things, O my father, is that vow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perform’d, alas too well! for thou didst pray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While looking up I felt the burning tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which from thy sightless sockets stream’d, drop down, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That to thy grave, and not thy living feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The oppressor might be led. Behold him there, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father! Theodofred! no longer now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In darkness, from thy heavenly seat look down,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And see before thy grave thine enemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In bonds, awaiting judgment at my hand!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus while the hero spake, Witiza stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Listening in agony, with open mouth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And head, half-raised, toward his sentence turn’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His eye-lids stiffen’d and pursed up, ... his eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rigid, and wild, and wide; and when the King</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had ceased, amid the silence which ensued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dastard’s chains were heard, link against link</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clinking. At length upon his knees he fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lifting up his trembling hands, outstretch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In supplication, ... Mercy! he exclaim’d....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chains, dungeons, darkness, ... any thing but death!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I did not touch his life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Roderick replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hour, whenever it had come, had found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A soul prepared: he lived in peace with Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And life prolong’d for him, was bliss delay’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But life, in pain and darkness and despair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For thee, all leprous as thou art with crimes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is mercy.... Take him hence, and let him see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The light of day no more!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Such Roderick was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When last I saw these courts, ... his theatre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of glory; ... such when last I visited</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My master’s grave! Ten years have hardly held</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their course, ... ten little years ... break, break, old heart....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh why art thou so tough!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">As thus he spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They reach’d the church. The door before his hand</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave way; both blinded with their tears, they went</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Straight to the tomb; and there Siverian knelt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bow’d his face upon the sepulchre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Weeping aloud; while Roderick, overpower’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And calling upon earth to cover him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Threw himself prostrate on his father’s grave.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus as they lay, an aweful voice in tones</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Severe address’d them. Who are ye, it said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That with your passion thus, and on this night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disturb my prayers? Starting they rose; there stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A man before them of majestic form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stature, clad in sackcloth, bare of foot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pale, and in tears, with ashes on his head.</div>

RODERICK AND PELAYO.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas not in vain that on her absent son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo’s mother from the bed of death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call’d for forgiveness, and in agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Besought his prayers; all guilty as she was,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sure he had not been human, if that cry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had fail’d to pierce him. When he heard the tale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bless’d the messenger, even while his speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was faltering, ... while from head to foot he shook</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With icey feelings from his inmost heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Effused. It changed the nature of his woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Making the burthen more endurable:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The life-long sorrow that remain’d, became</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A healing and a chastening grief, and brought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His soul, in close communion, nearer Heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he had been her first-born, and the love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which at her breast he drew, and from her smiles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from her voice of tenderness imbibed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave such unnatural horror to her crimes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That when the thought came over him, it seem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if the milk which with his infant life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had blended, thrill’d like poison through his frame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was a woe beyond all reach of hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till with the dreadful tale of her remorse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faith touch’d his heart; and ever from that day</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did he for her who bore him, night and morn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour out the anguish of his soul in prayer:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But chiefly as the night return’d, which heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her last expiring groans of penitence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then through the long and painful hours, before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The altar, like a penitent himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He kept his vigils; and when Roderick’s sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Subdued Witiza, and the land was free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Duly upon her grave he offer’d up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His yearly sacrifice of agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prayer. This was the night, and he it was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who now before Siverian and the King</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood up in sackcloth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">The old man, from fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Recovering and from wonder, knew him first.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is the Prince! he cried, and bending down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embraced his knees. The action and the word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awaken’d Roderick; he shook off the load</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of struggling thoughts, which pressing on his heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held him like one entranced; yet, all untaught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bend before the face of man, confused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awhile he stood, forgetful of his part.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when Siverian cried, My Lord, my Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now God be praised that I have found thee thus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My Lord and Prince, Spain’s only hope and mine!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Roderick, echoing him, exclaim’d, My Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Prince, Pelayo!... and approaching near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bent his knee obeisant: but his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earthward inclined; while the old man, looking up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From his low gesture to Pelayo’s face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wept at beholding him for grief and joy.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Siverian! cried the chief, ... of whom hath Death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bereaved me, that thou comest to Cordoba?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Children, or wife?... Or hath the merciless scythe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of this abhorr’d and jealous tyranny</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made my house desolate at one wide sweep?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">They are as thou couldst wish, the old man replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wert thou but lord of thine own house again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Spain were Spain once more. A tale of ill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I bear, but one that touches not the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like what thy fears forebode. The renegade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Numacian woos thy sister, and she lends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the vile slave, unworthily, her ear:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lady Gaudiosa hath in vain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Warn’d her of all the evils which await</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A union thus accurst: she sets at nought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her faith, her lineage, and thy certain wrath.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Pelayo hearing him, remain’d awhile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Silent; then turning to his mother’s grave, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O thou poor dust, hath then the infectious taint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Survived thy dread remorse, that it should run</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Guisla’s veins? he cried; ... I should have heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This shameful sorrow any where but here!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Humble thyself, proud heart; thou, gracious Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be merciful!... it is the original flaw, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what are we?... a weak unhappy race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born to our sad inheritance of sin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And death!... He smote his forehead as he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from his head the ashes fell, like snow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shaken from some dry beech-leaves, when a bird</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lights on the bending spray. A little while</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silence, rather than in thought, he stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Passive beneath the sorrow: turning then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what doth Gaudiosa counsel me?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He ask’d the old man; for she hath ever been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My wise and faithful counsellor.... He replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lady Gaudiosa bade me say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She sees the danger which on every part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Besets her husband’s house.... Here she had ceased;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when my noble Mistress gave in charge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How I should tell thee that in evil times</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bravest counsels ever are the best;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then that high-minded Lady thus rejoin’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whatever be my Lord’s resolve, he knows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I bear a mind prepared.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Brave spirits! cried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo, worthy to remove all stain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of weakness from their sex! I should be less</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than man, if, drawing strength where others find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their hearts most open to assault of fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I quail’d at danger. Never be it said</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Spain, that in the hour of her distress</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her women were as heroes, but her men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perform’d the woman’s part.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Roderick at that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look’d up, and taking up the word, exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Prince, in better days the pride of Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prostrate as she lies, her surest hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear now my tale. The fire which seem’d extinct</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath risen revigorate: a living spark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Auria’s ashes, by a woman’s hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Preserved and quicken’d, kindles far and wide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The beacon-flame o’er all the Asturian hills.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">There hath a vow been offer’d up, which binds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Us and our children’s children to the work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of holy hatred. In the name of Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That vow hath been pronounced, and register’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above, to be the bond whereby we stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For condemnation or acceptance. Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received the irrevocable vow, and Earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must witness its fulfilment; Earth and Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call upon thee, Pelayo! Upon thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spirits of thy royal ancestors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look down expectant; unto thee, from fields</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laid waste, and hamlets burnt, and cities sack’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blood of infancy and helpless age</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cries out; thy native mountains call for thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Echoing from all their armed sons thy name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And deem not thou that hot impatience goads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy countrymen to counsels immature.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Odoar and Urban from Visonia’s banks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Send me, their sworn and trusted messenger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To summon thee, and tell thee in their name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That now the hour is come: For sure it seems,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus saith the Primate, Heaven’s high will to rear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the soil of Spain a Spanish throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restoring in thy native line, O Prince,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sceptre to the Spaniard. Worthy son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that most ancient and heroic race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which with unweariable endurance still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath striven against its mightier enemies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roman or Carthaginian, Greek or Goth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So often by superior arms oppress’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More often by superior arts beguiled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet amid all its sufferings, all the waste</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sword and fire remorselessly employ’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unconquer’d and unconquerable still; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Son of that injured and illustrious stock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand forward thou, draw forth the sword of Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restore them to their rights, too long withheld,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And place upon thy brow the Spanish crown.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">When Roderick ceased, the princely Mountaineer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazed on the passionate orator awhile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With eyes intently fix’d, and thoughtful brow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then turning to the altar, he let fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sackcloth robe, which late with folded arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against his heart was prest; and stretching forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hands toward the crucifix, exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My God and my Redeemer! where but here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before thy aweful presence, in this garb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With penitential ashes thus bestrewn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could I so fitly answer to the call</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Spain; and for her sake, and in thy name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Accept the Crown of Thorns she proffers me!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">And where but here, said Roderick in his heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could I so properly, with humbled knee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And willing soul, confirm my forfeiture?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The action follow’d on that secret thought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He knelt, and took Pelayo’s hand, and cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First of the Spaniards, let me with this kiss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do homage to thee here, my Lord and King!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With voice unchanged and steady countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He spake; but when Siverian follow’d him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The old man trembled as his lips pronounced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The faltering vow; and rising he exclaim’d,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">God grant thee, O my Prince, a better fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than thy poor kinsman’s, who in happier days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received thy homage here! Grief choak’d his speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, bursting into tears, he sobb’d aloud.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tears too adown Pelayo’s manly cheek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roll’d silently. Roderick alone appear’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unmoved and calm; for now the royal Goth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had offer’d his accepted sacrifice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And therefore in his soul he felt that peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which follows painful duty well perform’d, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perfect and heavenly peace, ... the peace of God.</div>

ALPHONSO.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fain would Pelayo have that hour obey’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The call, commencing his adventurous flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As one whose soul impatiently endured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His country’s thraldom, and in daily prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imploring her deliverance, cried to Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How long, O Lord, how long!... But other thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Curbing his spirit, made him yet awhile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sustain the weight of bondage. Him alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all the Gothic baronage, the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Watch’d with regard of wary policy, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knowing his powerful name, his noble mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how in him the old Iberian blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of royal and remotest ancestry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From undisputed source flow’d undefiled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His mother’s after-guilt attainting not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The claim legitimate he derived from her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her first-born in her time of innocence.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He too of Chindasuintho’s regal line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sole remnant now, drew after him the love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all true Goths, uniting in himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus by this double right, the general heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Spain. For this the renegado crew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wretches in whom their conscious guilt and fear</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Engender’d cruellest hatred, still advised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The extinction of Pelayo’s house; but most</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The apostate Prelate, in iniquity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Witiza’s genuine brother as in blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orpas, pursued his life. He never ceased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With busy zeal, true traitor, to infuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His deadly rancour in the Moorish chief;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their only danger, ever he observed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was from Pelayo; root his lineage out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Caliph’s empire then would be secure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And universal Spain, all hope of change</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Being lost, receive the Prophet’s conquering law.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then did the Arch-villain urge the Moor at once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To cut off future peril, telling him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Death was a trusty keeper, and that none</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’er broke the prison of the grave. But here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keen malice overshot its mark: the Moor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who from the plunder of their native land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had bought the recreant crew that join’d his arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or cheaplier with their own possessions bribed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their sordid souls, saw through the flimsy show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of policy wherewith they sought to cloak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old enmity, and selfish aims: he scorn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To let their private purposes incline</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His counsels, and believing Spain subdued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smiled, in the pride of power and victory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disdainful at the thought of farther strife.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howbeit he held Pelayo at his court,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And told him that until his countrymen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Submissively should lay their weapons down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He from his children and paternal hearth</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apart must dwell; nor hope to see again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His native mountains and their vales beloved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till all the Asturian and Cantabrian hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had bow’d before the Caliph; Cordoba</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must be his nightly prison till that hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This night, by special favour from the Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ask’d and vouchsafed, he pass’d without the walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keeping his yearly vigil; on this night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore the princely Spaniard could not fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Being thus in strongest bonds by honour held;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor would he by his own escape expose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To stricter bondage, or belike to death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro’s son. The ancient enmity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rival houses from Pelayo’s heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had, like a thing forgotten, pass’d away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He pitied child and parent, separated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the stern mandate of unfeeling power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And almost with a father’s eyes beheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boy, his fellow in captivity.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For young Alphonso was in truth an heir</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of nature’s largest patrimony; rich</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In form and feature, growing strength of limb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A gentle heart, a soul affectionate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A joyous spirit fill’d with generous thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And genius heightening and ennobling all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blossom of all manly virtues made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His boyhood beautiful. Shield, gracious Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this ungenial season perilous, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus would Pelayo sometimes breathe in prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The aspirations of prophetic hope, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shield, gracious Heaven, the blooming tree! and let</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">This goodly promise, for thy people’s sake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yield its abundant fruitage.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">When the Prince,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With hope and fear and grief and shame disturb’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sad remembrance, and the shadowy light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of days before him, thronging as in dreams,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose quick succession fill’d and overpower’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awhile the unresisting faculty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could in the calm of troubled thoughts subdued</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seek in his heart for counsel, his first care</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was for the boy; how best they might evade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moor, and renegade’s more watchful eye;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leaving in some unsuspicious guise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The city, through what unfrequented track</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Safeliest pursue with speed their dangerous way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Consumed in cares like these, the fleeting hours</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went by. The lamps and tapers now grew pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And through the eastern window slanting fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The roseate ray of morn. Within those walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Returning day restored no cheerful sounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or joyous motions of awakening life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But in the stream of light the speckled motes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if in mimicry of insect play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Floated with mazy movement. Sloping down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over the altar pass’d the pillar’d beam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rested on the sinful woman’s grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if it enter’d there, a light from Heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So be it! cried Pelayo, even so!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in a momentary interval,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thought expelling thought, had left his mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open and passive to the influxes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of outward sense, his vacant eye was there....</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">So be it, Heavenly Father, even so!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus may thy vivifying goodness shed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgiveness there; for let not thou the groans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of dying penitence, nor my bitter prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before thy mercy-seat, be heard in vain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou, poor soul, who from the dolorous house</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of weeping and of pain, dost look to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To shorten and assuage thy penal term,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pardon me that these hours in other thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And other duties than this garb, this night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enjoin, should thus have past! Our mother-land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exacted of my heart the sacrifice;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a vigil must thy son perform</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Henceforth in woods and mountain fastnesses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tented fields, outwatching for her sake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The starry host, and ready for the work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of day, before the sun begins his course.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The noble Mountaineer, concluding then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With silent prayer the service of the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went forth. Without the porch awaiting him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He saw Alphonso, pacing to and fro</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With patient step and eye reverted oft.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, springing forward when he heard the door</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Move on its heavy hinges, ran to him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And welcomed him with smiles of youthful love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have been watching yonder moon, quoth he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How it grew pale and paler as the sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scatter’d the flying shades; but woe is me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For on the towers of Cordoba the while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That baleful crescent glitter’d in the morn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with its insolent triumph seem’d to mock</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The omen I had found.... Last night I dreamt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thou wert in the field in arms for Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I was at thy side: the infidels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beset us round, but we with our good swords</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hew’d out a way. Methought I stabb’d a Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who would have slain thee; but with that I woke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For joy, and wept to find it but a dream.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus as he spake a livelier glow o’erspread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His cheek, and starting tears again suffused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The brightening lustre of his eyes. The Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Regarded him a moment stedfastly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if in quick resolve; then looking round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On every side with keen and rapid glance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drew him within the church. Alphonso’s heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Throbb’d with a joyful boding as he mark’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The calmness of Pelayo’s countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kindle with solemn thoughts, expressing now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High purposes of resolute hope. He gazed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All eagerly to hear what most he wish’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If, said the Prince, thy dream were verified,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I indeed were in the field in arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Spain, ... wouldst thou be at Pelayo’s side?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I should break these bonds, and fly to rear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our country’s banner on our native hills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wouldst thou, Alphonso, share my dangerous flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dear boy, ... and wilt thou take thy lot with me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For death, or for deliverance?</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">Shall I swear?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied the impatient boy; and laying hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the altar, on his knee he bent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looking towards Pelayo with such joy</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of reverential love, as if a God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were present to receive the eager vow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, quoth Pelayo: what hast thou to do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With oaths?... Bright emanation as thou art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It were a wrong to thy unsullied soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sin to nature, were I to require</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Promise or vow from thee! Enough for me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thy heart answers to the stirring call.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso, follow thou in happy faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alway the indwelling voice that counsels thee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then, let fall the issue as it may,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall all thy paths be in the light of Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The peace of Heaven be with thee in all hours.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">How then, exclaim’d the boy, shall I discharge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The burthen of this happiness, ... how ease</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My overflowing soul!... Oh gracious God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall I behold my mother’s face again, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My father’s hall, ... my native hills and vales,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hear the voices of their streams again, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And free as I was born amid those scenes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beloved, maintain my country’s freedom there, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or, failing in the sacred enterprise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Die as becomes a Spaniard?... Saying thus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He lifted up his hands and eyes toward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The image of the Crucified, and cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Thou who didst with thy most precious blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Redeem us, Jesu! help us while we seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earthly redemption from this yoke of shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And misbelief and death.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">The noble boy</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then rose, and would have knelt again to clasp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo’s knees, and kiss his hand in act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of homage; but the Prince, preventing this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bent over him in fatherly embrace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And breathed a fervent blessing on his head.</div>

FLORINDA.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There sate a woman like a supplicant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Muffled and cloak’d, before Pelayo’s gate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awaiting when he should return that morn.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She rose at his approach, and bow’d her head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, with a low and trembling utterance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Besought him to vouchsafe her speech within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In privacy. And when they were alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the doors closed, she knelt and claspt his knees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saying, a boon! a boon! This night, O Prince,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast thou kept vigil for thy mother’s soul:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For her soul’s sake, and for the soul of him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom once, in happier days, of all mankind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou heldest for thy chosen bosom friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh for the sake of his poor suffering soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Refuse me not!</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">How should I dare refuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Being thus adjured? he answer’d. Thy request</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is granted, woman, ... be it what it may,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So it be lawful, and within the bounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of possible atchievement: ... aught unfit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wouldst not with these adjurations seek.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But who thou art, I marvel, that dost touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon that string, and ask in Roderick’s name!...</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bared her face, and, looking up, replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Florinda!... Shrinking then, with both her hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She hid herself, and bow’d her head abased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon her knee, ... as one who, if the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had oped beneath her, would have thrown herself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even like a lover, in the arms of Death.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Pelayo stood confused: he had not seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s daughter since in Roderick’s court,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glittering in beauty and in innocence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A radiant vision, in her joy she moved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More like a poet’s dream, or form divine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven’s prototype of perfect womanhood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So lovely was the presence, ... than a thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of earth and perishable elements.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now had he seen her in her winding-sheet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Less painful would that spectacle have proved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For peace is with the dead, and piety</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bringeth a patient hope to those who mourn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er the departed; but this alter’d face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bearing its deadly sorrow character’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came to him like a ghost, which in the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could find no rest. He, taking her cold hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raised her, and would have spoken; but his tongue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fail’d in its office, and could only speak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In under tones compassionate her name.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The voice of pity soothed and melted her;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the Prince bade her be comforted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proffering his zealous aid in whatsoe’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might please her to appoint, a feeble smile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pass’d slowly over her pale countenance,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like moonlight on a marble statue. Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Requite thee, Prince! she answer’d. All I ask</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is but a quiet resting-place, wherein</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A broken heart, in prayer and humble hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May wait for its deliverance. Even this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My most unhappy fate denies me here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Griefs which are known too widely and too well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I need not now remember. I could bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Privation of all Christian ordinances,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The woe which kills hath saved me too, and made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A temple of this ruin’d tabernacle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein redeeming God doth not disdain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To let his presence shine. And I could bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see the turban on my father’s brow, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sorrow beyond all sorrows, ... shame of shames, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet to be borne, while I with tears of blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And throes of agony, in his behalf</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Implore and wrestle with offended Heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This I have borne resign’d: but other ills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And worse assail me now; the which to bear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If to avoid be possible, would draw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Damnation down. Orpas, the perjured Priest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The apostate Orpas, claims me for his bride.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obdurate as he is, the wretch profanes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My sacred woe, and woos me to his bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thing I am, ... the living death thou seest!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Miscreant! exclaim’d Pelayo. Might I meet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That renegado, sword to scymitar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In open field, never did man approach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The altar for the sacrifice in faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More sure, than I should hew the villain down!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But how should Julian favour his demand?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Julian, who hath so passionately loved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His child, so dreadfully revenged her wrongs!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Count Julian, she replied, hath none but me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it hath, therefore, been his heart’s desire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see his ancient line by me preserved.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This was their covenant when in fatal hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Spain, and for themselves, in traitorous bond</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of union they combined. My father, stung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To madness, only thought of how to make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His vengeance sure; the Prelate, calm and cool,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he renounced his outward faith in Christ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indulged at once his hatred of the King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His inbred wickedness, and a haughty hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Versed as he was in treasons, to direct</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The invaders by his secret policy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And at their head, aided by Julian’s power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reign as a Moor upon that throne to which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The priestly order else had barr’d his way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The African hath conquer’d for himself;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Orpas coveteth Count Julian’s lands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And claims to have the covenant perform’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Friendless, and worse than fatherless, I come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To thee for succour. Send me secretly, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For well I know all faithful hearts must be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At thy devotion, ... with a trusty guide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guard me on the way, that I may reach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some Christian land, where Christian rites are free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there discharge a vow, alas! too long,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too fatally delay’d. Aid me in this</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Roderick’s sake, Pelayo! and thy name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall be remember’d in my latest prayer.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Be comforted! the Prince replied; but when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He spake of comfort, twice did he break off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The idle words, feeling that earth had none</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For grief so irremediable as hers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At length he took her hand, and pressing it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And forcing through involuntary tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mournful smile affectionate, he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say not that thou art friendless while I live!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou couldst not to a readier ear have told</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy sorrows, nor have ask’d in fitter hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What for my country’s honour, for my rank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My faith, and sacred knighthood, I am bound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In duty to perform; which not to do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would show me undeserving of the names</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Goth, Prince, Christian, even of Man. This day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lady, prepare to take thy lot with me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And soon as evening closes meet me here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Duties bring blessings with them, and I hold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy coming for a happy augury,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this most aweful crisis of my fate.</div>

RODERICK AND FLORINDA.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With sword and breast-plate, under rustic weeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conceal’d, at dusk Pelayo pass’d the gate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Florinda following near, disguised alike.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two peasants on their mules they seem’d, at eve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Returning from the town. Not distant far,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso by the appointed orange-grove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With anxious eye and agitated heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Watch’d for the Prince’s coming. Eagerly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At every foot-fall through the gloom he strain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His sight, nor did he recognize him when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Chieftain thus accompanied drew nigh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the expected signal called him on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doubting this female presence, half in fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obey’d the call. Pelayo too perceived</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boy was not alone; he not for that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Delay’d the summons, but lest need should be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laying hand upon his sword, toward him bent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In act soliciting speech, and low of voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enquired if friend or foe. Forgive me, cried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso, that I did not tell thee this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full as I was of happiness, before.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis Hoya, servant of my father’s house,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unto whose dutiful care and love, when sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To this vile bondage, I was given in charge.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How could I look upon my father’s face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I had in my joy deserted him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who was to me found faithful?... Right! replied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Prince; and viewing him with silent joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blessed the Mother, in his heart he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who gave thee birth! but sure of womankind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most blessed she whose hand her happy stars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall link with thine! and with that thought the form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Hermesind, his daughter, to his soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came in her beauty.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Soon by devious tracks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They turn’d aside. The favouring moon arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guide them on their flight through upland paths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remote from frequentage, and dales retired,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forest and mountain glen. Before their feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fire-flies, swarming in the woodland shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sprung up like sparks, and twinkled round their way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The timorous blackbird, starting at their step,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fled from the thicket with shrill note of fear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And far below them in the peopled dell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all the soothing sounds of eve had ceased,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The distant watch-dog’s voice at times was heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Answering the nearer wolf. All through the night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the hills they travell’d silently;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till when the stars were setting, at what hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The breath of Heaven is coldest, they beheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within a lonely grove the expected fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Roderick and his comrade anxiously</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look’d for the appointed meeting. Halting there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They from the burthen and the bit relieved</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their patient bearers, and around the fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Partook of needful food and grateful rest.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Bright rose the flame replenish’d; it illumed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cork-tree’s furrow’d rind, its rifts and swells</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And redder scars, ... and where its aged boughs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’erbower’d the travellers, cast upon the leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A floating, grey, unrealizing gleam.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso, light of heart, upon the heath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay carelessly dispread, in happy dreams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of home; his faithful Hoya slept beside.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Years and fatigue to old Siverian brought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Easy oblivion; and the Prince himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yielding to weary nature’s gentle will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgot his cares awhile. Florinda sate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beholding Roderick with fix’d eyes intent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet unregardant of the countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whereon they dwelt; in other thoughts absorb’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Collecting fortitude for what she yearn’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet trembled to perform. Her steady look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disturb’d the Goth, albeit he little ween’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What agony awaited him that hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her face, well nigh as changed as his, was now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half-hidden, and the lustre of her eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Extinct; nor did her voice awaken in him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One startling recollection when she spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So altered were its tones.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Father, she said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All thankful as I am to leave behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unhappy walls of Cordoba, not less</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of consolation doth my heart receive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At sight of one to whom I may disclose</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sins which trouble me, and at his feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay down repentantly, in Jesu’s name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The burthen of my spirit. In his name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear me, and pour into a wounded soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The balm of pious counsel.... Saying thus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She drew toward the minister ordain’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kneeling by him, Father, dost thou know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wretch who kneels beside thee? she enquired,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He answered, Surely we are each to each</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Equally unknown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Then said she, Here thou seest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One who is known too fatally for all, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The daughter of Count Julian.... Well it was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Roderick that no eye beheld him now;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From head to foot a sharper pang than death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrill’d him; his heart, as at a mortal stroke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ceased from its functions: his breath fail’d, and when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The power of life recovering set its springs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Again in action, cold and clammy sweat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starting at every pore suffused his frame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their presence help’d him to subdue himself;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For else, had none been nigh, he would have fallen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before Florinda prostrate on the earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in that mutual agony belike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both souls had taken flight. She mark’d him not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For having told her name, she bow’d her head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breathing a short and silent prayer to Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, as a penitent, she wrought herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To open to his eye her hidden wounds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Father, at length she said, all tongues amid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This general ruin shed their bitterness</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Roderick, load his memory with reproach,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with their curses persecute his soul....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why shouldst thou tell me this? exclaim’d the Goth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From his cold forehead wiping as he spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The death-like moisture; ... Why of Roderick’s guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me? Or thinkest thou I know it not?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! who hath not heard the hideous tale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Roderick’s shame! Babes learn it from their nurses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And children, by their mothers unreproved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Link their first execrations to his name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, it hath caught a taint of infamy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, like Iscariot’s, through all time shall last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reeking and fresh for ever!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">There! she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drawing her body backward where she knelt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stretching forth her arms with head upraised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There! it pursues me still!... I came to thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father, for comfort, and thou heapest fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon my head. But hear me patiently,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let me undeceive thee; self-abased,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not to arraign another, do I come;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I come a self-accuser, self-condemn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take upon myself the pain deserved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I have drank the cup of bitterness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And having drank therein of heavenly grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I must not put away the cup of shame.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus as she spake she falter’d at the close,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in that dying fall her voice sent forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Somewhat of its original sweetness. Thou!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou self-abased! exclaim’d the astonish’d King; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou self-condemn’d!... The cup of shame for thee!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee ... thee, Florinda!... But the very excess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of passion check’d his speech, restraining thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From farther transport, which had haply else</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Master’d him; and he sate like one entranced,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazing upon that countenance so fallen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So changed: her face, raised from its muffler now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was turn’d toward him, and the fire-light shone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full on its mortal paleness; but the shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conceal’d the King.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">She roused him from the spell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which held him like a statue motionless.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou too, quoth she, dost join the general curse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like one who when he sees a felon’s grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Casting a stone there as he passes by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Adds to the heap of shame. Oh what are we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Frail creatures as we are, that we should sit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In judgement man on man! and what were we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If the All-merciful should mete to us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the same rigorous measure wherewithal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sinner to sinner metes! But God beholds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The secrets of the heart, ... therefore his name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is Merciful. Servant of God, see thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hidden things of mine, and judge thou then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In charity thy brother who hath fallen....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, hear me to the end! I loved the King, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tenderly, passionately, madly loved him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sinful it was to love a child of earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With such entire devotion as I loved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick, the heroic Prince, the glorious Goth!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet methought this was its only crime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The imaginative passion seem’d so pure:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quiet and calm like duty, hope nor fear</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disturb’d the deep contentment of that love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was the sunshine of my soul, and like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A flower, I lived and flourish’d in his light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh bear not with me thus impatiently!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No tale of weakness this, that in the act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of penitence, indulgent to itself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With garrulous palliation half repeats</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sin it ill repents. I will be brief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shrink not from confessing how the love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which thus began in innocence, betray’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My unsuspecting heart; nor me alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But him, before whom, shining as he shone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With whatsoe’er is noble, whatsoe’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is lovely, whatsoever good and great,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was as dust and ashes, ... him, alas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This glorious being, this exalted Prince,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even him, with all his royalty of soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did this ill-omen’d, this accursëd love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To his most lamentable fall betray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And utter ruin. Thus it was: The King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By counsels of cold statesmen ill-advised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To an unworthy mate had bound himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In politic wedlock. Wherefore should I tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How Nature upon Egilona’s form,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Profuse of beauty, lavishing her gifts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Left, like a statue from the graver’s hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deformity and hollowness beneath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rich external? For the love of pomp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And emptiest vanity, hath she not incurr’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The grief and wonder of good men, the gibes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of vulgar ribaldry, the reproach of all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Profaning the most holy sacrament</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of marriage, to become chief of the wives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Abdalaziz, of the Infidel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moor, the tyrant-enemy of Spain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All know her now; but they alone who knew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What Roderick was can judge his wretchedness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To that light spirit and unfeeling heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In hopeless bondage bound. No children rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From this unhappy union, towards whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The springs of love within his soul confined</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might flow in joy and fulness; nor was he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One, like Witiza, of the vulgar crew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who in promiscuous appetite can find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All their vile nature seeks. Alas for man!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exuberant health diseases him, frail worm!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the slight bias of untoward chance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes his best virtue from the even line,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With fatal declination, swerve aside.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aye, thou mayest groan for poor mortality, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well, Father, mayest thou groan!</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">My evil fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made me an inmate of the royal house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Roderick found in me, if not a heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like his, ... for who was like the heroic Goth?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One which at least felt his surpassing worth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And loved him for himself.... A little yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bear with me, reverend Father, for I touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the point, and this long prologue goes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As justice bids, to palliate his offence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not mine. The passion, which I fondly thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such as fond sisters for a brother feel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grew day by day, and strengthen’d in its growth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the beloved presence had become</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Needful as food or necessary sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My hope, light, sunshine, life, and every thing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus lapt in dreams of bliss, I might have lived</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Contented with this pure idolatry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had he been happy: but I saw and knew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The inward discontent and household griefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which he subdued in silence; and alas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pity with admiration mingling then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alloy’d and lower’d and humanized my love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till to the level of my lowliness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It brought him down; and in this treacherous heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too often the repining thought arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That if Florinda had been Roderick’s Queen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then might domestic peace and happiness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have bless’d his home and crown’d our wedded loves.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too often did that sinful thought recur,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too feebly the temptation was repell’d.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">See, Father, I have probed my inmost soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have search’d to its remotest source the sin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tracing it through all its specious forms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fair disguisement, I present it now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even as it lies before the eye of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bare and exposed, convicted and condemn’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One eve, as in the bowers which overhang</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glen where Tagus rolls between his rocks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I roam’d alone, alone I met the King.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His countenance was troubled, and his speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like that of one whose tongue to light discourse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At fits constrain’d, betrays a heart disturb’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I too, albeit unconscious of his thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With anxious looks reveal’d what wandering words</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In vain essay’d to hide. A little while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did this oppressive intercourse endure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till our eyes met in silence, each to each</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Telling their mutual tale, then consciously</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Together fell abash’d. He took my hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And said, Florinda, would that thou and I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earlier had met! oh what a blissful lot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had then been mine, who might have found in thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sweet companion and the friend endear’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fruitful wife and crown of earthly joys!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou too shouldst then have been of womankind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Happiest, as now the loveliest.... And with that,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First giving way to passion first disclosed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He press’d upon my lips a guilty kiss, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! more guiltily received than given.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Passive and yielding, and yet self-reproach’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trembling I stood, upheld in his embrace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When coming steps were heard, and Roderick said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meet me to-morrow, I beseech thee, here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Queen of my heart! Oh meet me here again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My own Florinda, meet me here again!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tongue, eye, and pressure of the impassion’d hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Solicited and urged the ardent suit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from my hesitating hurried lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The word of promise fatally was drawn.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Roderick, Roderick! hadst thou told me all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy purpose at that hour, from what a world</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of woe had thou and I.... The bitterness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that reflection overcame her then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And choak’d her speech. But Roderick sate the while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Covering his face with both his hands close-prest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His head bow’d down, his spirit to such point</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sufferance knit, as one who patiently</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awaits the uplifted sword.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Till now, said she,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resuming her confession, I had lived,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If not in innocence, yet self-deceived,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And of my perilous and sinful state</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unconscious. But this fatal hour reveal’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To my awakening soul her guilt and shame;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in those agonies with which remorse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wrestling with weakness and with cherish’d sin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth triumph o’er the lacerated heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That night ... that miserable night ... I vow’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A virgin dedicate, to pass my life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Immured; and, like redeemëd Magdalen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or that Egyptian penitent, whose tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fretted the rock, and moisten’d round her cave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thirsty desert, so to mourn my fall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The struggle ending thus, the victory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus, as I thought, accomplish’d, I believed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My soul was calm, and that the peace of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Descended to accept and bless my vow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in this faith, prepared to consummate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacrifice, I went to meet the King.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See, Father, what a snare had Satan laid!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Roderick came to tell me that the Church</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From his unfruitful bed would set him free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I should be his Queen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">O let me close</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dreadful tale! I told him of my vow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from sincere and scrupulous piety,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But more, I fear me, in that desperate mood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of obstinate will perverse, the which, with pride</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shame and self-reproach, doth sometimes make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A woman’s tongue, her own worst enemy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Run counter to her dearest heart’s desire, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that unhappy mood did I resist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All his most earnest prayers to let the power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of holy Church, never more rightfully</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Invoked, he said, than now in our behalf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Release us from our fatal bonds. He urged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With kindling warmth his suit, like one whose life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung on the issue; I dissembled not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My cruel self-reproaches, nor my grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet desperately maintain’d the rash resolve;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till in the passionate argument he grew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Incensed, inflamed, and madden’d or possess’d, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Hell too surely at that hour prevail’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with such subtile toils enveloped him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That even in the extremity of guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No guilt he purported, but rather meant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An amplest recompence of life-long love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For transitory wrong, which fate perverse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus madly he deceived himself, compell’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And therefore stern necessity excused.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here then, O Father, at thy feet I own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Myself the guiltier; for full well I knew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These were his thoughts, but vengeance master’d me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in my agony I cursed the man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom I loved best.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">Dost thou recall that curse?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cried Roderick, in a deep and inward voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still with his head depress’d, and covering still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His countenance. Recall it? she exclaim’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father, I come to thee because I gave</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The reins to wrath too long, ... because I wrought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His ruin, death, and infamy.... O God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgive the wicked vengeance thus indulged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I forgive the King!... But teach me thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What reparation more than tears and prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May now be made; ... how shall I vindicate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His injured name, and take upon myself....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Daughter of Julian, firmly he replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speak not of that, I charge thee! On his fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Ethiop dye, fixed ineffaceably,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For ever will abide; so it must be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So should be: ’tis his rightful punishment;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if to the full measure of his sin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The punishment hath fallen, the more our hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That through the blood of Jesus he may find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sin forgiven him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Pausing then, he raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hand, and pointed where Siverian lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stretch’d on the heath. To that old man, said he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the mother of the unhappy Goth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell, if it please thee, ... not what thou hast pour’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into my secret ear, but that the child</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whom they mourn with anguish unallay’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sinn’d not from vicious will, or heart corrupt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But fell by fatal circumstance betray’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if in charity to them thou sayest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Something to palliate, something to excuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An act of sudden frenzy when the Fiend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’ercame him, thou wilt do for Roderick</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All he could ask thee, all that can be done</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On earth, and all his spirit could endure.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Venturing towards her an imploring look,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wilt thou join with me for his soul in prayer?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, and trembled as he spake. That voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sympathy was like Heaven’s influence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wounding at once and comforting the soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Father, Christ requite thee! she exclaim’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast set free the springs which withering griefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have closed too long. Forgive me, for I thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wert a rigid and unpitying judge;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One whose stern virtue, feeling in itself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No flaw of frailty, heard impatiently</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of weakness and of guilt. I wrong’d thee Father!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With that she took his hand, and kissing it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bathed it with tears. Then in a firmer speech,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Roderick, for Count Julian and myself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three wretchedest of all the human race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who have destroyed each other and ourselves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mutually wrong’d and wronging, let us pray!</div>

COUNT PEDRO’S CASTLE.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Twelve weary days with unremitting speed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shunning frequented tracks, the travellers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pursued their way; the mountain path they chose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The forest or the lonely heath wide-spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where cistus shrubs sole-seen exhaled at noon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their fine balsamic odour all around;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strew’d with their blossoms, frail as beautiful,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thirsty soil at eve; and when the sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Relumed the gladden’d earth, opening anew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their stores exuberant, prodigal as frail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whiten’d again the wilderness. They left</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dark Sierra’s skirts behind, and cross’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wilds where Ana in her native hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Collects her sister springs, and hurries on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her course melodious amid loveliest glens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With forest and with fruitage overbower’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These scenes profusely blest by Heaven they left,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where o’er the hazel and the quince the vine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wide-mantling spreads; and clinging round the cork</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ilex, hangs amid their dusky leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Garlands of brightest hue, with reddening fruit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pendant, or clusters cool of glassy green.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So holding on o’er mountain and o’er vale,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tagus they cross’d where midland on his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The King of Rivers rolls his stately stream;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rude Alverches wide and stony bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Duero distant far, and many a stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a field obscure, in future war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For bloody theatre of famous deeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Foredoom’d; and deserts where in years to come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall populous towns arise, and crested towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stately temples rear their heads on high.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Cautious with course circuitous they shunn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The embattled city, which in eldest time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice-greatest Hermes built, so fables say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now subjugate, but fated to behold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere long the heroic Prince (who passing now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unknown and silently the dangerous track,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turns thither his regardant eye) come down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Victorious from the heights, and bear abroad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her banner’d Lion, symbol to the Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rout and death through many an age of blood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo, there the Asturian hills! Far in the west,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Huge Rabanal and Foncebadon huge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pre-eminent, their giant bulk display,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Darkening with earliest shade the distant vales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Leon, and with evening premature.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far in Cantabria eastward, the long line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Extends beyond the reach of eagle’s eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When buoyant in mid-heaven the bird of Jove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soars at his loftiest pitch. In the north, before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The travellers the Erbasian mountains rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bounding the land beloved, their native land.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">How then, Alphonso, did thy eager soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chide the slow hours and painful way, which seem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lengthening to grow before their lagging pace!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Youth of heroic thought and high desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis not the spur of lofty enterprize</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That with unequal throbbing hurries now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unquiet heart, now makes it sink dismay’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis not impatient joy which thus disturbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that young breast the healthful spring of life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joy and ambition have forsaken him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His soul is sick with hope. So near his home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So near his mother’s arms; ... alas! perchance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long’d-for meeting may be yet far off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As earth from heaven. Sorrow in these long months</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of separation may have laid her low;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or what if at his flight the bloody Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath sent his ministers of slaughter forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he himself should thus have brought the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his father’s head?... Sure Hoya too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The same dark presage feels, the fearful boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said in himself; or wherefore is his brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus overcast with heaviness, and why</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looks he thus anxiously in silence round?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Just then that faithful servant raised his hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turning to Alphonso with a smile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He pointed where Count Pedro’s towers far off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peer’d in the dell below; faint was the smile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And while it sate upon his lips, his eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retain’d its troubled speculation still.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For long had he look’d wistfully in vain,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeking where far or near he might espy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From whom to learn if time or chance had wrought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Change in his master’s house: but on the hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor goat-herd could he see, nor traveller,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor huntsman early at his sports afield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor angler following up the mountain glen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His lonely pastime; neither could he hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Carol, or pipe, or shout of shepherd’s boy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor woodman’s axe, for not a human sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disturb’d the silence of the solitude.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Is it the spoiler’s work? At yonder door</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold the favourite kidling bleats unheard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The next stands open, and the sparrows there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boldly pass in and out. Thither he turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To seek what indications were within;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chesnut-bread was on the shelf, the churn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if in haste forsaken, full and fresh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The recent fire had moulder’d on the hearth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And broken cobwebs mark’d the whiter space</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where from the wall the buckler and the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had late been taken down. Wonder at first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had mitigated fear, but Hoya now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Return’d to tell the symbols of good hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they prick’d forward joyfully. Ere long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perceptible above the ceaseless sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of yonder stream, a voice of multitudes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if in loud acclaim, was heard far off;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And nearer as they drew, distincter shouts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came from the dell, and at Count Pedro’s gate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The human swarm were seen, ... a motley group,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maids, mothers, helpless infancy, weak age,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wondering children and tumultuous boys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hot youth and resolute manhood gather’d there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In uproar all. Anon the moving mass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falls in half circle back, a general cry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bursts forth, exultant arms are lifted up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And caps are thrown aloft, as through the gate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro’s banner came. Alphonso shriek’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For joy, and smote his steed and gallop’d on.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Fronting the gate the standard-bearer holds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His precious charge. Behind the men divide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In order’d files; green boyhood presses there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And waning eld, pleading a youthful soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Intreats admission. All is ardour here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hope and brave purposes and minds resolved.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor where the weaker sex is left apart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth aught of fear find utterance, though perchance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some paler cheeks might there be seen, some eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Big with sad bodings, and some natural tears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro’s war-horse in the vacant space</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strikes with impatient hoof the trodden turf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gazing round upon the martial show,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proud of his stately trappings, flings his head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And snorts and champs the bit, and neighing shrill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wakes the near echo with his voice of joy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The page beside him holds his master’s spear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shield and helmet. In the castle-gate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro stands, his countenance resolved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But mournful, for Favinia on his arm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung, passionate with her fears, and held him back.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go not, she cried, with this deluded crew!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She hath not, Pedro, with her frantic words</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bereft thy faculty, ... she is crazed with grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her delirium hath infected these:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, Pedro, thou art calm; thou dost not share</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The madness of the crowd; thy sober mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surveys the danger in its whole extent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sees the certain ruin, ... for thou know’st</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know thou hast no hope. Unhappy man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why then for this most desperate enterprize</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wilt thou devote thy son, thine only child?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not for myself I plead, nor even for thee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art a soldier, and thou canst not fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The face of death; and I should welcome it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the best visitant whom Heaven could send.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not for our lives I speak then, ... were they worth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thought of preservation; ... Nature soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must call for them; the sword that should cut short</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sorrow’s slow work were merciful to us.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But spare Alphonso! there is time and hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In store for him. O thou who gavest him life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seal not his death, his death and mine at once!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Peace! he replied: thou know’st there is no choice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I did not raise the storm; I cannot turn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its course aside! but where yon banner goes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy Lord must not be absent! Spare me then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Favinia, lest I hear thy honour’d name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now first attainted with deserved reproach.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boy is in God’s hands. He who of yore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Walk’d with the sons of Judah in the fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from the lion’s den drew Daniel forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unhurt, can save him, ... if it be his will.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Even as he spake, the astonish’d troop set up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shout of joy which rung through all the hills.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso heeds not how they break their ranks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gather round to greet him; from his horse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Precipitate and panting off he springs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pedro grew pale, and trembled at his sight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Favinia claspt her hands, and looking up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Heaven as she embraced the boy, exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lord God, forgive me for my sinful fears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unworthy that I am, ... my son, my son!</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Always I knew thee for a generous foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo! said the Count; and in our time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of enmity, thou too, I know, didst feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The feud between us was but of the house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not of the heart. Brethren in arms henceforth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We stand or fall together: nor will I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look to the event with one misgiving thought, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That were to prove myself unworthy now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Heaven’s benignant providence, this hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarcely by less than miracle, vouchsafed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will believe that we have days in store</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of hope, now risen again as from the dead, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of vengeance, ... of portentous victory, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, maugre all unlikelihoods, ... of peace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us then here indissolubly knit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our ancient houses, that those happy days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When they arrive, may find us more than friends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bound by closer than fraternal ties.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast a daughter, Prince, to whom my heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yearns now, as if in winning infancy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her smiles had been its daily food of love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I need not tell thee what Alphonso is, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou know’st the boy!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
    <div class="verse indent22">Already had that hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied Pelayo, risen within my soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Thou, who in thy mercy from the house</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Moorish bondage hast deliver’d us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fulfil the pious purposes for which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, in thy presence, thus we pledge our hands!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Strange hour to plight espousals! yielding half</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To superstitious thoughts, Favinia cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And these strange witnesses!... The times are strange,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thoughtful speech composed her Lord replies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what thou seest accords with them. This day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is wonderful; nor could auspicious Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With fairer or with fitter omen gild</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our enterprize, when strong in heart and hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We take the field, preparing thus for works</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of piety and love. Unwillingly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I yielded to my people’s general voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thinking that she who with her powerful words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To this excess had roused and kindled them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spake from the spirit of her griefs alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not with prophetic impulse. Be that sin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgiven me! and the calm and quiet faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, in the place of incredulity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath fill’d me, now that seeing I believe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth give of happy end to righteous cause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A presage, not presumptuous, but assured.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Then Pedro told Pelayo how from vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To vale the exalted Adosinda went,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exciting sire and son, in holy war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conquering or dying, to secure their place</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Paradise: and how reluctantly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mourning for his child by his own act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus doom’d to death, he bade with heavy heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His banner be brought forth. Devoid alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of purpose and of hope himself, he meant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To march toward the western Mountaineers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Odoar by his counsel might direct</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their force conjoin’d. Now, said he, we must haste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Cangas, there, Pelayo, to secure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With timely speed, I trust in God, thy house.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Then looking to his men, he cried, Bring forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The armour which in Wamba’s wars I wore...</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro mark’d the rising glow of joy,..</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doubly to thee, Alphonso, he pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day above all other days is blest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From whence as from a birth-day thou wilt date</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy life in arms!</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">Rejoicing in their task,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The servants of the house with emulous love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dispute the charge. One brings the cuirass, one</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The sword, his comrade lifts the helm on high:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The greaves, the gauntlets they divide; a spur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seems now to dignify the officious hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which for such service bears it to his Lord.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Greek artists in the imperial city forged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That splendid armour, perfect in their craft;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With curious skill they wrought it, framed alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To shine amid the pageantry of war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for the proof of battle. Many a time</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso from his nurse’s lap had stretch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His infant hands toward it eagerly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where gleaming to the central fire it hung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High in the hall; and many a time had wish’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With boyish ardour, that the day were come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Pedro to his prayers would grant the boon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His dearest heart’s desire. Count Pedro then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would smile, and in his heart rejoice to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble instinct manifest itself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then too Favinia with maternal pride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would turn her eyes exulting to her Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in that silent language bid him mark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His spirit in his boy; all danger then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was distant, and if secret forethought faint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of manhood’s perils, and the chance of war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hateful to mothers, pass’d across her mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ill remote gave to the present hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A heighten’d feeling of secure delight.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">No season this for old solemnities,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For wassailry and sport; ... the bath, the bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vigil, ... all preparatory rites</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Omitted now, ... here in the face of Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the vassals of his father’s house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With them in instant peril to partake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chance of life or death, the heroic boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dons his first arms; the coated scales of steel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which o’er the tunic to his knees depend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hose, the sleeves of mail; bareheaded then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He stood. But when Count Pedro took the spurs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bent his knee in service to his son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso from that gesture half drew back,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starting in reverence, and a deeper hue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spread o’er the glow of joy which flush’d his cheeks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do thou the rest, Pelayo! said the Count;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shall the ceremony of this hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exceed in honour what in form it lacks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Prince from Hoya’s faithful hand receiv’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sword; he girt it round the youth, and drew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And placed it in his hand; unsheathing then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His own good falchion, with its burnish’d blade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He touch’d Alphonso’s neck, and with a kiss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave him his rank in arms.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Thus long the crowd</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had look’d intently on, in silence hush’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud and continuous now with one accord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shout following shout, their acclamations rose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blessings were breathed from every heart, and joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Powerful alike in all, which as with force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of an inebriating cup inspired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The youthful, from the eye of age drew tears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The uproar died away, when standing forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick with lifted hand besought a pause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For speech, and moved towards the youth. I too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Young Baron, he began, must do my part;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not with prerogative of earthly power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But as the servant of the living God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The God of Hosts. This day thou promisest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To die when honour calls thee for thy faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For thy liege Lord, and for thy native land;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The duties which at birth we all contract,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are by the high profession of this hour</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And thine own noble nature more than all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are sureties for thee. But these dreadful times</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Demand a farther pledge; for it hath pleased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Highest, as he tried his Saints of old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So in the fiery furnace of his wrath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To prove and purify the sons of Spain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they must knit their spirits to the proof,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or sink, for ever lost. Hold forth thy sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Young Baron, and before thy people take</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vow which, in Toledo’s sacred name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor as these weeds bespeak me, I am here</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The sword, and looking, while his heart beat fast,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Through every heart the rapid feeling ran, ...</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The young and old, the father and the son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At once they knelt; with one accord they cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For us, and for our seed! with one accord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They cross’d their fervent arms, and with bent head</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inclined toward that aweful voice from whence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The inspiring impulse came. The Royal Goth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made answer, I receive your vow for Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for the Lord of Hosts: your cause is good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go forward in his spirit and his strength.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Ne’er in his happiest hours had Roderick</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">His princely gifts, as dignified him now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When with slow movement, solemnly upraised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward the kneeling troop he spread his arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if the expanded soul diffused itself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And carried to all spirits with the act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its effluent inspiration. Silently</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The people knelt, and when they rose, such awe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held them in silence, that the eagle’s cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who far above them, at her highest flight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A speck scarce visible, gyred round and round,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was heard distinctly; and the mountain stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which from the distant glen sent forth its sounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wafted upon the wind, grew audible</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that deep hush of feeling, like the voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of waters in the stillness of the night.</div>

COUNT EUDON.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That aweful silence still endured, when one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who to the northern entrance of the vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had turn’d his casual eye, exclaim’d, The Moors!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For from the forest verge a troop were seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hastening toward Pedro’s hall. Their forward speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was check’d when they beheld his banner spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And saw his order’d spears in prompt array</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marshall’d to meet their coming. But the pride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of power and insolence of long command</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prick’d on their Chief presumptuous: We are come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Late for prevention, cried the haughty Moor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But never time more fit for punishment!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These unbelieving slaves must feel and know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their master’s arm!... On, faithful Musselmen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On ... on, ... and hew down the rebellious dogs!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then as he spurr’d his steed, Allah is great!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mahommed is his Prophet! he exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And led the charge.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Count Pedro met the Chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In full career; he bore him from his horse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A full spear’s length upon the lance transfix’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then leaving in his breast the mortal shaft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pass’d on, and breaking through the turban’d files</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open’d a path. Pelayo, who that day</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fought in the ranks afoot, for other war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet unequipp’d, pursued and smote the foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ever on Alphonso at his side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retain’d a watchful eye. The gallant boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave his good sword that hour its earliest taste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Moorish blood, ... that sword whose hungry edge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the fair course of all his glorious life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From that auspicious day, was fed so well.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cheap was the victory now for Spain achieved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the first fervour of their zeal inspired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Mountaineers, ... the presence of their Chiefs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sight of all dear objects, all dear ties,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The air they breathed, the soil whereon they trod,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Duty, devotion, faith, and hope and joy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And little had the misbelievers ween’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In such impetuous onset to receive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A greeting deadly as their own intent;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Victims they thought to find, not men prepared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And eager for the fight; their confidence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore gave way to wonder, and dismay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Effected what astonishment began.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scatter’d before the impetuous Mountaineers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Buckler and spear and scymitar they dropt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in precipitate route they fled before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Asturian sword: the vales and hills and rocks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received their blood, and where they fell the wolves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At evening found them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">From the fight apart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two Africans had stood, who held in charge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Eudon. When they saw their countrymen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falter, give way, and fly before the foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One turn’d toward him with malignant rage,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And saying, Infidel! thou shalt not live</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To join their triumph! aim’d against his neck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The moony falchion’s point. His comrade raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hasty hand and turn’d its edge aside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet so that o’er the shoulder glancing down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It scarr’d him as it pass’d. The murderous Moor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not tarrying to secure his vengeance, fled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While he of milder mood, at Eudon’s feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell and embraced his knees. The mountaineer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who found them thus, withheld at Eudon’s voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wrathful hand, and led them to his Lord.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Count Pedro and Alphonso and the Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood on a little rocky eminence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which overlook’d the vale. Pedro had put</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His helmet off, and with sonorous horn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blew the recall; for well he knew what thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calm as the Prince appear’d and undisturb’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay underneath his silent fortitude;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how at this eventful juncture speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imported more than vengeance. Thrice he sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long-resounding signal forth, which rung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From hill to hill, re-echoing far and wide.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slow and unwillingly his men obey’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The swelling horn’s reiterated call;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repining that a single foe escaped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The retribution of that righteous hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With lingering step reluctant from the chase</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They turn’d, ... their veins full-swoln, their sinews strung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For battle still, their hearts unsatisfied;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their swords were dropping still with Moorish blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And where they wiped their reeking brows, the stain</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Moorish gore was left. But when they came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Pedro, with Alphonso at his side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood to behold their coming, then they press’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All emulous, with gratulation round,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Extolling for his deeds that day display’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble boy. Oh! when had Heaven, they said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With such especial favour manifest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illustrated a first essay in arms!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They bless’d the father from whose loins he sprung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mother at whose happy breast he fed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pray’d that their young hero’s fields might be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many, and all like this.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Thus they indulged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The honest heart, exuberant of love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When that loquacious joy at once was check’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Eudon and the Moor were brought before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro. Both came fearfully and pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But with a different fear: the African</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Felt at this crisis of his destiny</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such apprehension as without reproach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might blanch a soldier’s cheek, when life and death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hang on another’s will, and helplessly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He must abide the issue. But the thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which quail’d Count Eudon’s heart, and made his limbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quiver, were of his own unworthiness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old enmity, and that he stood in power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of hated and hereditary foes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I came not with them willingly! he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Addressing Pedro and the Prince at once,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rolling from each to each his restless eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aghast, ... the Moor can tell I had no choice;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They forced me from my castle: ... in the fight</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">They would have slain me: ... see I bleed! The Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can witness that a Moorish scymitar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inflicted this: ... he saved me from worse hurt: ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I did not come in arms: ... he knows it all; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speak, man, and let the truth be known to clear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My innocence!</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Thus as he ceased, with fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rapid utterance panting open-mouth’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro half represt a mournful smile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein compassion seem’d to mitigate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His deep contempt. Methinks, said he, the Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might with more reason look himself to find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An intercessor, than be call’d upon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To play the pleader’s part. Didst thou then save</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Baron from thy comrades?</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Let my Lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Show mercy to me, said the Musselman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I am free from falsehood. We were left,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I and another, holding him in charge;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My fellow would have slain him when he saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How the fight fared: I turn’d the scymitar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aside, and trust that life will be the meed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For life by me preserved.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Nor shall thy trust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rejoin’d the Count, be vain. Say farther now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From whence ye came? ... your orders what? ... what force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Gegio? and if others like yourselves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are in the field?</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">The African replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We came from Gegio, order’d to secure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This Baron on the way, and seek thee here</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bear thee hence in bonds. A messenger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Cordoba, whose speed denoted well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He came with urgent tidings, was the cause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of this our sudden movement. We went forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three hundred men; an equal force was sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Cangas, on like errand as I ween.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Four hundred in the city then were left.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If other force be moving from the south,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know not, save that all appearances</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Denote alarm and vigilance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">The Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fix’d upon Eudon then his eye severe;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Baron, he said, the die of war is cast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What part art thou prepared to take? against,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or with the oppressor?</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Not against my friends, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not against you!... the irresolute wretch replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hasty, yet faltering in his fearful speech:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ... have ye weigh’d it well?... It is not yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too late, ... their numbers, ... their victorious force,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which hath already trodden in the dust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sceptre of the Goths: ... the throne destroy’d, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our towns subdued, ... our country overrun, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The people to the yoke of their new Lords</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resign’d in peace.... Can I not mediate?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were it not better through my agency</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To gain such terms, ... such honourable terms....</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Terms! cried Pelayo, cutting short at once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That dastard speech, and checking, ere it grew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too powerful for restraint, the incipient wrath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which in indignant murmurs breathing round,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose like a gathering storm, learn thou what terms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Asturias, this day speaking by my voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth constitute to be the law between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee and thy Country. Our portentous age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As with an earthquake’s desolating force,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath loosen’d and disjointed the whole frame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of social order, and she calls not now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For service with the force of sovereign will.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That which was common duty in old times,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Becomes an arduous, glorious virtue now;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every one, as between Hell and Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In free election must be left to chuse.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Asturias asks not of thee to partake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cup which we have pledged; she claims from none</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dauntless fortitude, the mind resolved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which only God can give; ... therefore such peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As thou canst find where all around is war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She leaves thee to enjoy. But think not, Count,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That because thou art weak, one valiant arm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One generous spirit must be lost to Spain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vassal owes no service to the Lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who to his Country doth acknowledge none.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The summons which thou hast not heart to give,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I and Count Pedro over thy domains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will send abroad; the vassals who were thine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will fight beneath our banners, and our wants</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall from thy lands, as from a patrimony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which hath reverted to the common stock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be fed: such tribute, too, as to the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou renderest, we will take: It is the price</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which in this land for weakness must be paid</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">While evil stars prevail. And mark me, Chief!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fear is a treacherous counsellor! I know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou thinkëst that beneath his horses’s hoofs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moor will trample our poor numbers down;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But join not, in contempt of us and Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His multitudes! for if thou shouldst be found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against thy country, on the readiest tree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those recreant bones shall rattle in the wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the birds have left them bare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent36">As thus he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Eudon heard and trembled: every joint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was loosen’d, every fibre of his flesh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrill’d, and from every pore effused, cold sweat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clung on his quivering limbs. Shame forced it forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Envy, and inward consciousness, and fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Predominant, which stifled in his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hatred and rage. Before his livid lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could shape to utterance their essay’d reply,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Compassionately Pedro interposed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go, Baron, to the Castle, said the Count:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There let thy wound be look’d to, and consult</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy better mind at leisure. Let this Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Attend upon thee there, and when thou wilt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Follow thy fortunes.... To Pelayo then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He turn’d, and saying, All-too-long, O Prince,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath this unlook’d-for conflict held thee here, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bade his gallant men begin their march.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Flush’d with success, and in auspicious hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Mountaineers set forth. Blessings and prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pursued them at their parting, and the tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which fell were tears of fervour, not of grief.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun was verging to the western slope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Heaven, but they till midnight travell’d on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Renewing then at early dawn their way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They held their unremitting course from morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till latest eve, such urgent cause impell’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And night had closed around, when to the vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Sella in her ampler bed receives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pionia’s stream they came. Massive and black</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo’s castle there was seen; its lines</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And battlements against the deep blue sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Distinct in solid darkness visible.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No light is in the tower. Eager to know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The worst, and with that fatal certainty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To terminate intolerable dread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He spurr’d his courser forward. All his fears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too surely are fulfill’d, ... for open stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The doors, and mournfully at times a dog</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fills with his howling the deserted hall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moment overcome with wretchedness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Silent Pelayo stood! recovering then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lord God, resign’d he cried, thy will be done!</div>

THE RESCUE.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Count, said Pelayo, Nature hath assign’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two sovereign remedies for human grief;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Religion, surest, firmest, first and best,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strength to the weak and to the wounded balm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And strenuous action next. Think not I came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With unprovided heart. My noble wife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the last solemn words, the last farewell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With which she charged her secret messenger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Told me that whatsoe’er was my resolve,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bore a mind prepared. And well I know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The evil, be it what it may, hath found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In her a courage equal to the hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Captivity, or death, or what worse pangs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She in her children may be doom’d to feel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will never make that steady soul repent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its virtuous purpose. I too did not cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My single life into the lot, but knew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These dearer pledges on the die were set;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if the worst have fallen, I shall but bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in my breast, which, with transfiguring power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of piety, makes chastening sorrow take</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The form of hope, and sees, in Death, the friend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the restoring Angel. We must rest</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perforce, and wait what tidings night may bring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haply of comfort. Ho there! kindle fires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And see if aught of hospitality</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can yet within these mournful walls be found!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus while he spake, lights were descried far off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moving among the trees, and coming sounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were heard as of a distant multitude.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anon a company of horse and foot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Advancing in disorderly array,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came up the vale; before them and beside</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their torches flash’d on Sella’s rippling stream;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now gleam’d through chesnut groves, emerging now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er their huge boughs and radiated leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cast broad and bright a transitory glare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sight inspired with strength the mountaineers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All sense of weariness, all wish for rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At once were gone; impatient in desire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of second victory alert they stood;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the hostile symbols, which from far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imagination to their wish had shaped,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vanish’d in nearer vision, high-wrought hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Departing, left the spirit pall’d and blank.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No turban’d race, no sons of Africa</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were they who now came winding up the vale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As waving wide before their horses’ feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The torch-light floated, with its hovering glare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blackening the incumbent and surrounding night.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Helmet and breast-plate glitter’d as they came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spears erect; and nearer as they drew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were the loose folds of female garments seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On those who led the company. Who then</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had stood beside Pelayo, might have heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The beating of his heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">But vainly there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sought he with wistful eye the well-known forms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beloved; and plainly might it now be seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That from some bloody conflict they return’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Victorious, ... for at every saddle-bow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A gorey head was hung. Anon they stopt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Levelling in quick alarm their ready spears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hold! who goes there? cried one. A hundred tongues</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sent forth with one accord the glad reply,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Friends and Asturians. Onward moved the lights, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The people knew their Lord.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Then what a shout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rung through the valley! From their clay-built nests,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath the overbrowing battlements,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now first disturb’d, the affrighted martins flew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And uttering notes of terror short and shrill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the yellow glare and lurid smoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wheel’d giddily. Then plainly was it shown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How well the vassals loved their generous Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How like a father the Asturian Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was dear. They crowded round; they claspt his knees;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They snatch’d his hand; they fell upon his neck, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They wept; ... they blest Almighty Providence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which had restored him thus from bondage free;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God was with them and their good cause, they said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hand was here.... His shield was over them, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His spirit was abroad, ... His power display’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pointing to their bloody trophies then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They told Pelayo there he might behold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The first-fruits of the harvest they should soon</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reap in the field of war! Benignantly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With voice and look and gesture, did the Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To these warm greetings of tumultuous joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Respond; and sure if at that moment aught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could for awhile have overpower’d those fears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which from the inmost heart o’er all his frame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diffused their chilling influence, worthy pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sympathy of love and joy and hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had then possess’d him wholly. Even now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His spirit rose; the sense of power, the sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his brave people, ready where he led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To fight their country’s battles, and the thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of instant action, and deliverance, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If Heaven, which thus far had protected him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should favour still, ... revived his heart, and gave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fresh impulse to its spring. In vain he sought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid that turbulent greeting to enquire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Gaudiosa was, his children where,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who call’d them to the field, who captain’d them;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how these women, thus with arms and death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Environ’d, came amid their company?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For yet, amid the fluctuating light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tumult of the crowd, he knew them not.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Guisla was one. The Moors had found in her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A willing and concerted prisoner.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gladly to Gegio, to the renegade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On whom her loose and shameless love was bent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had she set forth; and in her heart she cursed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The busy spirit, who, with powerful call</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rousing Pelayo’s people, led them on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In quick pursual, and victoriously</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Achieved the rescue, to her mind perverse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unwelcome as unlook’d for. With dismay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She recognized her brother, dreaded now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More than he once was dear; her countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was turn’d toward him, ... not with eager joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To court his sight, and meeting its first glance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exchange delightful welcome, soul with soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hers was the conscious eye, that cannot chuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But look to what it fears. She could not shun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His presence, and the rigid smile constrain’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With which she coldly drest her features, ill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conceal’d her inward thoughts, and the despite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of obstinate guilt and unrepentant shame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sullenly thus upon her mule she sate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Waiting the greeting which she did not dare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bring on. But who is she that at her side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a stately war-horse eminent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Holds the loose rein with careless hand? A helm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Presses the clusters of her flaxen hair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shield is on her arm; her breast is mail’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sword-belt is her girdle, and right well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It may be seen that sword hath done its work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To-day, for upward from the wrist her sleeve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is stiff with blood. An unregardant eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As one whose thoughts were not of earth, she cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the turmoil round. One countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So strongly mark’d, so passion-worn was there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That it recall’d her mind. Ha! Maccabee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lifting her arm, exultingly she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did I not tell thee we should meet in joy?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well, Brother, hast thou done thy part, ... I too</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have not been wanting! Now be His the praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From whom the impulse came!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">That startling call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That voice so well remember’d, touch’d the Goth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With timely impulse now; for he had seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His Mother’s face, ... and at her sight, the past</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And present mingled like a frightful dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which from some dread reality derives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its deepest horror. Adosinda’s voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dispersed the waking vision. Little deem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rusilla at that moment that the child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whom her supplications day and night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were offer’d, breathed the living air. Her heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was calm; her placid countenance, though grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deeper than time had left its traces there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retain’d its dignity serene; yet when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Siverian, pressing through the people, kiss’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her reverend hand, some quiet tears ran down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As she approach’d the Prince, the crowd made way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Respectful. The maternal smile which bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her greeting, from Pelayo’s heart at once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dispell’d its boding. What he would have ask’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She knew, and bending from her palfrey down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Told him that they for whom he look’d were safe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that in secret he should hear the rest.</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How calmly gliding through the dark-blue sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The midnight Moon ascends! Her placid beams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through thinly scatter’d leaves and boughs grotesque,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mottle with mazy shades the orchard slope;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, o’er the chesnut’s fretted foliage grey</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And massy, motionless they spread; here shine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the crags, deepening with blacker night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their chasms; and there the glittering argentry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ripples and glances on the confluent streams.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lovelier, purer light than that of day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rests on the hills; and oh how awefully</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into that deep and tranquil firmament</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The watchman on the battlements partakes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The stillness of the solemn hour; he feels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The silence of the earth, the endless sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of flowing water soothes him, and the stars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which in that brightest moon-light well-nigh quench’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce visible, as in the utmost depth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of yonder sapphire infinite, are seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draw on with elevating influence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward eternity the attemper’d mind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Musing on worlds beyond the grave he stands,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the Virgin Mother silently</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prefers her hymn of praise.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">The mountaineers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the castle, round their mouldering fires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lie on the hearth outstretch’d. Pelayo’s hall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is full, and he upon his careful couch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hears all around the deep and long-drawn breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sleep: for gentle night hath brought to these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perfect and undisturb’d repose, alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of corporal powers and inward faculty.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wakeful the while he lay, yet more by hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than grief or anxious thoughts possess’d, ... though grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Guisla’s guilt, which freshen’d in his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The memory of their wretched mother’s crime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still made its presence felt, like the dull sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of some perpetual inward malady;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the whole peril of the future lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before him clearly seen. He had heard all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How that unworthy sister, obstinate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In wrong and shameless, rather seem’d to woo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The upstart renegado than to wait</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wooing; how, as guilt to guilt led on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spurning at gentle admonition first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Gaudiosa hopelessly forbore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From farther counsel, then in sullen mood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resentful, Guisla soon began to hate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The virtuous presence before which she felt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her nature how inferior, and her fault</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How foul. Despiteful thus she grew, because</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Humbled yet unrepentant. Who could say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To what excess bad passions might impel</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A woman thus possess’d? She could not fail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mark Siverian’s absence, for what end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her conscience but too surely had divined;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Gaudiosa, well aware that all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the vile paramour was thus made known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had to safe hiding-place with timely fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Removed her children. Well the event had proved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How needful was that caution; for at night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She sought the mountain solitudes, and morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld Numacian’s soldiers at the gate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet did not sorrow in Pelayo’s heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For this domestic shame prevail that hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor gathering danger weigh his spirit down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The anticipated meeting put to flight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These painful thoughts; to-morrow will restore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All whom his heart holds dear; his wife beloved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No longer now remember’d for regret,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is present to his soul with hope and joy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His inward eye beholds Favila’s form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In opening youth robust, and Hermesind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His daughter, lovely as a budding rose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their images beguile the hours of night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till with the earliest morning he may seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their secret hold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">The nightingale not yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had ceased her song, nor had the early lark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her dewy nest forsaken, when the Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upward beside Pionia took his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward Auseva. Heavily to him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impatient for the morrow’s happiness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long night had linger’d, but it seem’d more long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Roderick’s aching heart. He too had watch’d</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For dawn, and seen the earliest break of day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And heard its earliest sounds; and when the Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Went forth, the melancholy man was seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pensive pace upon Pionia’s side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wandering alone and slow. For he had left</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wearying place of his unrest, that morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With its cold dews might bathe his throbbing brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with its breath allay the feverish heat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That burnt within. Alas! the gales of morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reach not the fever of a wounded heart!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How shall he meet his Mother’s eye, how make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His secret known, and from that voice revered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obtain forgiveness, ... all that he has now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ask, ere on the lap of earth in peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He lay his head resign’d? In silent prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He supplicated Heaven to strengthen him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against that trying hour, there seeking aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where all who seek shall find; and thus his soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received support, and gather’d fortitude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Never than now more needful, for the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was nigh. He saw Siverian drawing near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with a dim but quick foreboding met</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The good old man; yet when he heard him say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My Lady sends to seek thee, like a knell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To one expecting and prepared for death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But fearing the dread point that hastens on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It smote his heart. He follow’d silently,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And knit his suffering spirit to the proof.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">He went resolved to tell his Mother all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fall at her feet, and drinking the last dregs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of bitterness, receive the only good</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth had in store for him. Resolved for this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He went; yet was it a relief to find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That painful resolution must await</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fitter season, when no eye but Heaven’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might witness to their mutual agony.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s daughter with Rusilla sate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both had been weeping, both were pale, but calm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With head as for humility abased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick approach’d, and bending, on his breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He cross’d his humble arms. Rusilla rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In reverence to the priestly character,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with a mournful eye regarding him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus she began. Good Father, I have heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From my old faithful servant and true friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou didst reprove the inconsiderate tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in the anguish of its spirit pour’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A curse upon my poor unhappy child.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Father Maccabee, this is a hard world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hasty in its judgements! Time has been,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When not a tongue within the Pyrenees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dared whisper in dispraise of Roderick’s name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest, if the conscious air had caught the sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vengeance of the honest multitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should fall upon the traitorous head, or brand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For life-long infamy the lying lips.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now if a voice be raised in his behalf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis noted for a wonder, and the man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who utters the strange speech shall be admired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For such excess of Christian charity.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy Christian charity hath not been lost; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father, I feel its virtue: ... it hath been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Balm to my heart; ... with words and grateful tears, ...</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">All that is left me now for gratitude, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thank thee, and beseech thee in thy prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thou wilt still remember Roderick’s name.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Roderick so long had to this hour look’d on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That when the actual point of trial came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Torpid and numb’d it found him; cold he grew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as the vital spirits to the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retreated, o’er his wither’d countenance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deathy and damp, a whiter paleness spread.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unmoved the while, the inward feeling seem’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even in such dull insensibility</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As gradual age brings on, or slow disease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath whose progress lingering life survives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The power of suffering. Wondering at himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet gathering confidence, he raised his eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then slowly shaking as he bent his head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O venerable Lady, he replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If aught may comfort that unhappy soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It must be thy compassion, and thy prayers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She whom he most hath wrong’d, she who alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On earth can grant forgiveness for his crime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She hath forgiven him; and thy blessing now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were all that he could ask, ... all that could bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Profit or consolation to his soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he hath been as sure we may believe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A penitent sincere.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Oh had he lived,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied Rusilla, never penitence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had equall’d his! full well I know his heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vehement in all things. He would on himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have wreak’d such penance as had reach’d the height</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fleshly suffering ... yea, which being told</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With its portentuous rigour should have made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The memory of his fault, o’erpower’d and lost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In shuddering pity and astonishment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fade like a feebler horror. Otherwise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seem’d good to Heaven. I murmur not, nor doubt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boundless mercy of redeeming love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For sure I trust that not in his offence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Harden’d and reprobate was my lost son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A child of wrath, cut off!... that dreadful thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not even amid the first fresh wretchedness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the ruin burst around me like a flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assail’d my soul. I ever deem’d his fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An act of sudden madness; and this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath in unlook’d-for confirmation given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A livelier hope, a more assurëd faith.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smiling benignant then amid her tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She took Florinda by the hand, and said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I little thought that I should live to bless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s daughter! She hath brought to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The last, the best, the only comfort earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could minister to this afflicted heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my grey hairs may now unto the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go down in peace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">Happy, Florinda cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are they for whom the grave hath peace in store!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wrongs they have sustain’d, the woes they bear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pass not that holy threshold, where Death heals</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The broken heart. O Lady, thou may’st trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In humble hope, through Him who on the Cross</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave his atoning blood for lost mankind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To meet beyond the grave thy child forgiven.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">I too with Roderick there may interchange</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgiveness. But the grief which wastes away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This mortal frame, hastening the happy hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of my enlargement, is but a light part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of what my soul endures!... that grief hath lost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its sting: ... I have a keener sorrow here, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One which, ... but God forefend that dire event, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May pass with me the portals of the grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with a thought, like sin which cannot die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embitter Heaven. My father hath renounced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hope in Christ! It was his love for me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which drove him to perdition.... I was born</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ruin all who loved me, ... all I loved!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps I sinn’d in leaving him; ... that fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rises within me to disturb the peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which I should else have found.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">To Roderick then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pious mourner turn’d her suppliant eyes:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Father, there is virtue in thy prayers!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I do beseech thee offer them to Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his behalf! For Roderick’s sake, for mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wrestle with Him whose name is Merciful,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Julian may with penitence be touch’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And clinging to the Cross, implore that grace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which ne’er was sought in vain. For Roderick’s sake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mine, pray for him! We have been the cause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his offence! What other miseries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May from that same unhappy source have risen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are earthly, temporal, reparable all; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if a soul be lost through our misdeeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That were eternal evil! Pray for him,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good Father Maccabee, and be thy prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More fervent, as the deeper is the crime.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">While thus Florinda spake, the dog who lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before Rusilla’s feet, eyeing him long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wistfully, had recognised at length,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Changed as he was and in those sordid weeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His royal master. And he rose and lick’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wither’d hand, and earnestly look’d up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With eyes whose human meaning did not need</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The aid of speech; and moan’d, as if at once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To court and chide the long-withheld caress.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A feeling uncommix’d with sense of guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or shame, yet painfulest, thrill’d through the King;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he to self-controul now long inured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Represt his rising heart, nor other tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full as his struggling bosom was, let fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than seem’d to follow on Florinda’s words.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looking toward her then, yet so that still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shunn’d the meeting of her eye, he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Virtuous and pious as thou art, and ripe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Heaven, O Lady, I must think the man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath not by his good Angel been cast off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whom thy supplications rise. The Lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose justice doth in its unerring course</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Visit the children for the sire’s offence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall He not in his boundless mercy hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The daughter’s prayer, and for her sake restore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The guilty parent? My soul shall with thine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In earnest and continual duty join....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How deeply, how devoutly, He will know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whom the cry is raised!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
    <div class="verse indent26">Thus having said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deliberately, in self-possession still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Himself from that most painful interview</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dispeeding, he withdrew. The watchful dog</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Follow’d his footsteps close. But he retired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the thickest grove; there yielding way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To his o’erburthen’d nature, from all eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apart, he cast himself upon the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And threw his arms around the dog, and cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While tears stream’d down, Thou, Theron, then hast known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy poor lost master, ... Theron, none but thou!</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime Pelayo up the vale pursued</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eastward his way, before the sun had climb’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Auseva’s brow, or shed his silvering beams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon Europa’s summit, where the snows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all revolving seasons hold their seat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A happy man he went, his heart at rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of hope and virtue and affection full,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To all exhilarating influences</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of earth and heaven alive. With kindred joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He heard the lark, who from her airy height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On twinkling pinions poised, pour’d forth profuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In thrilling sequence of exuberant song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As one whose joyous nature overflow’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With life and power, her rich and rapturous strain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The early bee, buzzing along the way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From flower to flower, bore gladness on its wing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To his rejoicing sense; and he pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With quicken’d eye alert, the frolic hare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where from the green herb in her wanton path</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She brush’d away the dews. For he long time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far from his home and from his native hills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had dwelt in bondage; and the mountain breeze,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which he had with the breath of infancy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inhaled, such impulse to his heart restored,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if the seasons had roll’d back, and life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enjoy’d a second spring.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Through fertile fields</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He went, by cots with pear-trees overbower’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or spreading to the sun their trelliced vines;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through orchards now, and now by thymy banks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where wooden hives in some warm nook were hid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From wind and shower; and now thro’ shadowy paths,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where hazels fringed Pionia’s vocal stream;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till where the loftier hills to narrower bound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Confine the vale, he reach’d those huts remote</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which should hereafter to the noble line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Soto origin and name impart:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A gallant lineage, long in fields of war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And faithful chronicler’s enduring page</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blazon’d: but most by him illustrated,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Avid of gold, yet greedier of renown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom not the spoils of Atabalipa</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could satisfy insatiate, nor the fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that wide empire overthrown appease;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he to Florida’s disastrous shores</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In evil hour his gallant comrades led,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through savage woods and swamps, and hostile tribes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Apalachian arrows, and the snares</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wilier foes, hunger, and thirst, and toil;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till from ambition’s feverish dream the touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Death awoke him; and when he had seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fruit of all his treasures, all his toil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Foresight, and long endurance, fade away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth to the restless one refusing rest,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the great river’s midland bed he left</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His honour’d bones.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">A mountain rivulet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now calm and lovely in its summer course,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held by those huts its everlasting way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Towards Pionia. They whose flocks and herds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drink of its water call it Deva. Here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo southward up the ruder vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Traced it, his guide unerring. Amid heaps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of mountain wreck, on either side thrown high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wide-spread traces of its wintry might,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tortuous channel wound; o’er beds of sand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here silently it flows; here from the rock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rebutted, curls and eddies; plunges here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Precipitate; here roaring among crags,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It leaps and foams and whirls and hurries on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grey alders here and bushy hazels hid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mossy side; their wreath’d and knotted feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bared by the current, now against its force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repaying the support they found, upheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bank secure. Here, bending to the stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The birch fantastic stretch’d its rugged trunk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tall and erect from whence, as from their base,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each like a tree, its silver branches grew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cherry here hung for the birds of heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its rosy fruit on high. The elder there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its purple berries o’er the water bent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heavily hanging. Here, amid the brook,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grey as the stone to which it clung, half root,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half trunk, the young ash rises from the rock;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there its parent lifts a lofty head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spreads its graceful boughs; the passing wind</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With twinkling motion lifts the silent leaves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shakes its rattling tufts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">Soon had the Prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behind him left the farthest dwelling-place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of man; no fields of waving corn were here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor wicker storehouse for the autumnal grain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vineyard, nor bowery fig, nor fruitful grove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only the rocky vale, the mountain stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Incumbent crags, and hills that over hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arose on either hand, here hung with woods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here rich with heath, that o’er some smooth ascent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its purple glory spread, or golden gorse;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bare here, and striated with many a hue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scored by the wintry rain; by torrents here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Riven, and with overhanging rocks abrupt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo, upward as he cast his eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where crags loose-hanging o’er the narrow pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impended, there beheld his country’s strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Insuperable, and in his heart rejoiced.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh that the Musselman were here, he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all his myriads! While thy day endures,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moor! thou may’st lord it in the plains; but here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath Nature for the free and brave prepared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sanctuary, where no oppressor’s power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No might of human tyranny can pierce.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The tears which started then sprang not alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From lofty thoughts of elevating joy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For love and admiration had their part,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And virtuous pride. Here then thou hast retired,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My Gaudiosa! in his heart he said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Excellent woman! ne’er was richer boon</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">By fate benign to favour’d man indulged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than when thou wert before the face of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Given me to be my children’s mother, brave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And virtuous as thou art! Here thou hast fled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou who wert nurst in palaces, to dwell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In rocks and mountain caves!... The thought was proud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet not without a sense of inmost pain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For never had Pelayo till that hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So deeply felt the force of solitude.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High over head the eagle soar’d serene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the grey lizard on the rocks below</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bask’d in the sun: no living creature else</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this remotest wilderness was seen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor living voice was there, ... only the flow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Deva, and the rushing of its springs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long in the distance heard, which nearer now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With endless repercussion deep and loud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Throbb’d on the dizzy sense.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">The ascending vale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long straiten’d by the narrowing mountains, here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was closed. In front a rock, abrupt and bare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood eminent, in height exceeding far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All edifice of human power, by King</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or Caliph, or barbaric Sultan rear’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or mightier tyrants of the world of old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assyrian or Egyptian, in their pride;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet far above, beyond the reach of sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swell after swell, the heathery mountain rose.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, in two sources, from the living rock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The everlasting springs of Deva gush’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a smooth and grassy plat below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Nature there as for an altar drest,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">They join’d their sister stream, which from the earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well’d silently. In such a scene rude man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pardonable error might have knelt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Feeling a present Deity, and made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His offering to the fountain Nymph devout.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The arching rock disclosed above the springs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A cave, where hugest son of giant birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That e’er of old in forest of romance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Gainst knights and ladies waged discourteous war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Erect within the portal might have stood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The broken stone allow’d for hand and foot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No difficult ascent, above the base</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In height a tall man’s stature, measured thrice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No holier spot than Covadonga Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boasts in her wide extent, though all her realms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be with the noblest blood of martyrdom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In elder or in later days enrich’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And glorified with tales of heavenly aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By many a miracle made manifest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor in the heroic annals of her fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth she show forth a scene of more renown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, save the hunter, drawn in keen pursuit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beyond his wonted haunts, or shepherd’s boy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Following the pleasure of his straggling flock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None knew the place.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Pelayo, when he saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those glittering sources and their sacred cave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took from his side the bugle silver-tipt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with a breath long drawn and slow expired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sent forth that strain, which, echoing from the walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Cangas, wont to tell his glad return.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">When from the chace he came. At the first sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Favila started in the cave, and cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My father’s horn!... A sudden flush suffused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hermesind’s cheek, and she with quicken’d eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look’d eager to her mother silently;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Gaudiosa trembled and grew pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doubting her sense deceived. A second time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bugle breathed its well-known notes abroad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Hermesind around her mother’s neck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Threw her white arms, and earnestly exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis he!... But when a third and broader blast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rung in the echoing archway, ne’er did wand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With magic power endued, call up a sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So strange, as sure in that wild solitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It seem’d, when from the bowels of the rock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mother and her children hastened forth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She in the sober charms and dignity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of womanhood mature, nor verging yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon decay; in gesture like a Queen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such inborn and habitual majesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ennobled all her steps, ... or Priestess, chosen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because within such faultless work of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inspiring Deity might seem to make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its habitation known.... Favila such</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In form and stature as the Sea Nymph’s son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When that wise Centaur from his cave well-pleased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld the boy divine his growing strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against some shaggy lionet essay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fixing in the half-grown mane his hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roll with him in fierce dalliance intertwined.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But like a creature of some higher sphere</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His sister came; she scarcely touch’d the rock,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">So light was Hermesind’s aërial speed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beauty and grace and innocence in her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In heavenly union shone. One who had held</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The faith of elder Greece, would sure have thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She was some glorious nymph of seed divine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oread or Dryad, of Diana’s train</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The youngest and the loveliest: yea she seem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Angel, or soul beatified, from realms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of bliss, on errand of parental love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To earth re-sent, ... if tears and trembling limbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With such celestial natures might consist.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Embraced by all, in turn embracing each,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The husband and the father for awhile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgot his country and all things beside:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life hath few moments of such pure delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such foretaste of the perfect joy of Heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the thought recurr’d of sufferings past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perils which threaten’d still, and arduous toil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet to be undergone, remember’d griefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heighten’d the present happiness; and hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the shadows of futurity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shone like the sun upon the morning mists,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When driven before his rising rays they roll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And melt and leave the prospect bright and clear.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">When now Pelayo’s eyes had drank their fill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of love from those dear faces, he went up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To view the hiding place. Spacious it was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As that Sicilian cavern in the hill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein earth-shaking Neptune’s giant son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Duly at eve was wont to fold his flock,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere the wise Ithacan, over that brute force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By wiles prevailing, for a life-long night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seel’d his broad eye. The healthful air had here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Free entrance, and the cheerful light of heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But at the end, an opening in the floor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rock disclosed a wider vault below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which never sun-beam visited, nor breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of vivifying morning came to cheer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No light was there but that which from above</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In dim reflection fell, or found its way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Broken and quivering, through the glassy stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where through the rock it gush’d. That shadowy light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sufficed to show, where from their secret bed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waters issued; with whose rapid course,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with whose everlasting cataracts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such motion to the chill damp atmosphere</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was given, as if the solid walls of rock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were shaken with the sound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Glad to respire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The upper air, Pelayo hasten’d back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From that drear den. Look! Hermesind exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Taking her father’s hand, thou hast not seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My chamber: ... See!... did ever ring-dove chuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In so secure a nook her hiding-place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or build a warmer nest? ’Tis fragrant too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As warm, and not more sweet than soft; for thyme</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And myrtle with the elastic heath are laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, over all, this dry and pillowy moss ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smiling she spake. Pelayo kiss’d the child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, sighing, said within himself, I trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Heaven, whene’er thy May of life is come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet bird, that thou shalt have a blither bower!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fitlier, he thought, such chamber might beseem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some hermit of Hilarion’s school austere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or old Antonius, he who from the hell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his bewilder’d phantasy saw fiends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In actual vision, a foul throng grotesque</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all horrific shapes and forms obscene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crowd in broad day before his open eyes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That feeling cast a momentary shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sadness o’er his soul. But deeper thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he might have foreseen the things to come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would there have fill’d him; for within that cave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His own remains were one day doom’d to find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their final place of rest; and in that spot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where that dear child with innocent delight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had spread her mossy couch, the sepulchre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall in the consecrated rock be hewn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where with Alphonso, her beloved lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laid side by side, must Hermesind partake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The everlasting marriage-bed, when he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leaving a name perdurable on earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath changed his earthly for a heavenly crown.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dear child, upon that fated spot she stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In all the beauty of her opening youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In health’s rich bloom, in virgin innocence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While her eyes sparkled and her heart o’erflow’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pure and perfect joy of filial love.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Many a slow century since that day hath fill’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its course, and countless multitudes have trod</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pilgrim feet that consecrated cave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet not in all those ages, amid all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The untold concourse, hath one breast been swoln</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With such emotions as Pelayo felt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hour. O Gaudiosa, he exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou couldst seek for shelter here, amid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This aweful solitude, in mountain caves!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou noble spirit! Oh when hearts like thine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grow on this sacred soil, would it not be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In me, thy husband, double infamy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tenfold guilt, if I despair’d of Spain?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In all her visitations, favouring Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath left her still the unconquerable mind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thus being worthy of redemption, sure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is she to be redeem’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Beholding her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through tears he spake, and prest upon her lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A kiss of deepest love. Think ever thus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She answer’d, and that faith will give the power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In which it trusts. When to this mountain hold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These children, thy dear images, I brought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I said within myself, where should they fly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to the bosom of their native hills?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I brought them here as to a sanctuary,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where, for the temple’s sake, the indwelling God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would guard his supplicants. O my dear Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proud as I was to know that they were thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was it a sin if I almost believed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Spain, her destiny being link’d with theirs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must save the precious charge?</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">So let us think,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chief replied, so feel and teach and act.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spain is our common parent: let the sons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be to the parent true, and in her strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Heaven, their sure deliverance they will find.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Heart can conceive most perfect! Faithful love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long crost by envious stars, hath there attain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its crown, in endless matrimony given;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The youthful mother there hath to the font</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her first-born borne, and there, with deeper sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of gratitude for that dear babe redeem’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From threatening death, return’d to pay her vows.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ne’er on nuptial, nor baptismal day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor from their grateful pilgrimage discharged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did happier group their way down Deva’s vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rejoicing hold, than this blest family,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er whom the mighty Spirit of the Land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spread his protecting wings. The children, free</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In youthhead’s happy season from all cares</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That might disturb the hour, yet capable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that intense and unalloyed delight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which childhood feels when it enjoys again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dear parental presence long deprived;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor were the parents now less bless’d than they,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even to the height of human happiness;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Gaudiosa and her Lord that hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let no misgiving thoughts intrude: she fix’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her hopes on him, and his were fix’d on Heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hope in that courageous heart derived</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such rooted strength and confidence assured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In righteousness, that ’twas to him like faith ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An everlasting sunshine of the soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illumining and quickening all its powers.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">But on Pionia’s side meantime a heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As generous, and as full of noble thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay stricken with the deadliest bolts of grief.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a smooth grey stone sate Roderick there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wind above him stirr’d the hazel boughs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And murmuring at his feet the river ran.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sate with folded arms and head declined</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his breast, feeding on bitter thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till nature gave him in the exhausted sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of woe a respite something like repose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then the quiet sound of gentle winds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And waters with their lulling consonance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beguiled him of himself. Of all within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oblivious there he sate, sentient alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of outward nature, ... of the whispering leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That soothed his ear, ... the genial breath of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That fann’d his cheek, ... the stream’s perpetual flow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, with its shadows and its glancing lights,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dimples and thread-like motions infinite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For ever varying and yet still the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like time toward eternity, ran by.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resting his head upon his master’s knees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the bank beside him Theron lay.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">What matters change of state and circumstance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or lapse of years, with all their dread events,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To him? What matters it that Roderick wears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crown no longer, nor the sceptre wields?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is the dear-loved hand, whose friendly touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had flatter’d him so oft; it is the voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At whose glad summons to the field so oft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From slumber he had started, shaking off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dreams of the chace, to share the actual joy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eye, whose recognition he was wont</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To watch and welcome with exultant tongue.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">A coming step, unheard by Roderick, roused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His watchful ear, and turning he beheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Siverian. Father, said the good old man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As Theron rose and fawn’d about his knees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast thou some charm, which draws about thee thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hearts of all our house, ... even to the beast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That lacks discourse of reason, but too oft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With uncorrupted feeling and dumb faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Puts lordly man to shame?... The king replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis that mysterious sense by which mankind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To fix their friendships and their loves are led,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And which with fainter influence doth extend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To such poor things as this. As we put off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cares and passions of this fretful world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It may be too that we thus far approach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To elder nature, and regain in part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The privilege through sin in Eden lost.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The timid hare soon learns that she may trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The solitary penitent, and birds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will light upon the hermit’s harmless hand.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus Roderick answer’d in excursive speech,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thinking to draw the old man’s mind from what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might touch him else too nearly, and himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disposed to follow on the lure he threw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As one whom such imaginations led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of the world of his own miseries.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to regardless ears his words were given,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For on the dog Siverian gazed the while,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pursuing his own thoughts. Thou hast not felt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exclaim’d the old man, the earthquake and the storm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The kingdom’s overthrow, the wreck of Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ruin of thy royal master’s house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have reach’d not thee!... Then turning to the King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the destroying enemy drew nigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toledo, he continued, and we fled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before their fury, even while her grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was fresh, my Mistress would not leave behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This faithful creature. Well we knew she thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Roderick then, although she named him not;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For never since the fatal certainty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell on us all, hath that unhappy name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save in her prayers, been known to pass her lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before this day. She names him now, and weeps;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But now her tears are tears of thankfulness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For blessed hath thy coming been to her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all who loved the King.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">His faltering voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here fail’d him, and he paused: recovering soon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When that poor injured Lady, he pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did in my presence to the Prince absolve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unhappy King....</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">Absolve him! Roderick cried,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in that strong emotion turn’d his face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sternly toward Siverian, for the sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of shame and self-reproach drove from his min</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All other thoughts. The good old man replied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of human judgements humanly I speak.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who knows not what Pelayo’s life hath been?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not happier in all dear domestic ties,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than worthy for his virtue of the bliss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which is that virtue’s fruit; and yet did he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Absolve, upon Florinda’s tale, the King.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Siverian, thus he said, what most I hoped,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And still within my secret heart believed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is now made certain. Roderick hath been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More sinn’d against than sinning. And with that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He claspt his hands, and, lifting them to Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cried, Would to God that he were yet alive!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For not more gladly did I draw my sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against Witiza in our common cause,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than I would fight beneath his banners now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And vindicate his name!</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Did he say this?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Prince? Pelayo? in astonishment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick exclaim’d.... He said it, quoth the old man.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None better knew his kinsman’s noble heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None loved him better, none bewail’d him more:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as he felt, like me, for his reproach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A deeper grief than for his death, even so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He cherish’d in his heart the constant thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Something was yet untold, which, being known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would palliate his offence, and make the fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of one till then so excellently good,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Less monstrous, less revolting to belief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More to be pitied, more to be forgiven.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">While thus he spake, the fall’n King felt his face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Burn, and his blood flow fast. Down, guilty thoughts!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firmly he said within his soul; lie still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou heart of flesh! I thought thou hadst been quell’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And quell’d thou shalt be! Help me, O my God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I may crucify this inward foe!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, thou hast help’d me, Father! I am strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Saviour, in thy strength.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">As he breath’d thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His inward supplications, the old man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eyed him with frequent and unsteady looks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had a secret trembling on his lips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hesitated, still irresolute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In utterance to embody the dear hope:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fain would he have it strengthen’d and assured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By this concording judgement, yet he fear’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To have it chill’d in cold accoil. At length</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Venturing, he brake with interrupted speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The troubled silence. Father Maccabee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I cannot rest till I have laid my heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open before thee. When Pelayo wish’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That his poor kinsman were alive to rear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His banner once again, a sudden thought..</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hope.. a fancy.. what shall it be call’d?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Possess’d me, that perhaps the wish might see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its glad accomplishment,.. that Roderick lived,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And might in glory take the field once more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Spain.... I see thou startest at the thought!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet spurn it not with hasty unbelief,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">As though ’twere utterly beyond the scope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of possible contingency. I think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I have calmly satisfied myself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How this is more than idle fancy, more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than mere imaginations of a mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which from its wishes builds a baseless faith.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His horse, his royal robe, his horned helm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His mail and sword were found upon the field;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if King Roderick had in battle fallen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sword, I know, would only have been found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clench’d in the hand which, living, knew so well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wield the dreadful steel! Not in the throng</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Confounded, nor amid the torpid stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opening with ignominious arms a way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For flight, would he have perish’d! Where the strife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was hottest, ring’d about with slaughter’d foes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should Roderick have been found: by this sure mark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye should have known him, if nought else remain’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That his whole body had been gored with wounds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And quill’d with spears, as if the Moors had felt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in his single life the victory lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More than in all the host!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Siverian’s eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shone with a youthful ardour while he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His gathering brow grew stern, and as he raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His arm, a warrior’s impulse character’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The impassion’d gesture. But the King was calm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And heard him with unchanging countenance;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he had taken his resolve, and felt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once more the peace of God within his soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in that hour when by his father’s grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He knelt before Pelayo.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
    <div class="verse indent24">Soon the old man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pursued in calmer tones, ... Thus much I dare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Believe, that Roderick fell not on that day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When treason brought about his overthrow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If yet he live, for sure I think I know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His noble mind, ’tis in some wilderness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where, in some savage den inhumed, he drags</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The weary load of life, and on his flesh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As on a mortal enemy, inflicts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fierce vengeance with immitigable hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh that I knew but where to bend my way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his dear search! my voice perhaps might reach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His heart, might reconcile him to himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restore him to his mother ere she dies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His people and his country: with the sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Them and his own good name should he redeem.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh might I but behold him once again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leading to battle these intrepid bands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such as he was, ... yea rising from his fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More glorious, more beloved! Soon I believe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joy would accomplish then what grief hath fail’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To do with this old heart, and I should die</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clasping his knees with such intense delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That when I woke in Heaven, even Heaven itself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could have no higher happiness in store.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus fervently he spake, and copious tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ran down his cheeks. Full oft the Royal Goth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since he came forth again among mankind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had trembled lest some curious eye should read</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His lineaments too closely; now he long’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To fall upon the neck of that old man,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And give his full heart utterance. But the sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of duty, by the pride of self-controul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Corroborate, made him steadily repress</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His yearning nature. Whether Roderick live,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Paying in penitence the bitter price</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sin, he answered, or if earth hath given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rest to his earthly part, is only known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To him and Heaven. Dead is he to the world;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let not these imaginations rob</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His soul of thy continual prayers, whose aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too surely, in whatever world, he needs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The faithful love that mitigates his fault,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heavenward addrest, may mitigate his doom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Living or dead, old man, be sure his soul, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It were unworthy else, ... doth hold with thine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entire communion! Doubt not he relies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firmly on thee, as on a father’s love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Counts on thy offices, and joins with thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In sympathy and fervent act of faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though regions, or though worlds, should intervene.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lost as he is, to Roderick this must be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy first, best, dearest duty; next must be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hold right onward in that noble path,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which he would counsel, could his voice be heard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now therefore aid me, while I call upon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Leaders and the People, that this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We may acclaim Pelayo for our King.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, when from Covadonga, down the vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Holding his way, the princely mountaineer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came with that happy family in sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Cangas and his native towers, far off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He saw before the gate, in fair array,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The assembled land. Broad banners were display’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spears were sparkling to the sun, shields shone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And helmets glitter’d, and the blairing horn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With frequent sally of impatient joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Provoked the echoes round. Well he areeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From yonder ensigns and augmented force,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Odoar and the Primate from the west</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have brought their aid; but wherefore all were thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Instructed as for some great festival,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He found not, till Favila’s quicker eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Catching the ready buckler, the glad boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leapt up, and clapping his exultant hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shouted, King! King! my father shall be King</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day! Pelayo started at the word,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the first thought which smote him brought a sigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Roderick’s fall; the second was of hope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deliverance for his country, for himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enduring fame, and glory for his line.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That high prophetic forethought gather’d strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As looking to his honour’d mate, he read</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her soul’s accordant augury; her eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brighten’d; the quicken’d action of the blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tinged with a deeper hue her glowing cheek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on her lips there sate a smile which spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The honourable pride of perfect love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rejoicing, for her husband’s sake, to share</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lot he chose, the perils he defied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lofty fortune which their faith foresaw.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Roderick, in front of all the assembled troops,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held the broad buckler, following to the end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That steady purpose to the which his zeal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had this day wrought the Chiefs. Tall as himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Erect it stood beside him, and his hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung resting on the rim. This was an hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sweeten’d life, repaid and recompensed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All losses; and although it could not heal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All griefs, yet laid them for awhile to rest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The active agitating joy that fill’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vale, that with contagious influence spread</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld the busy scene. None shared or knew</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>

    <div class="verse indent2">Among the chiefs conspicuous, Urban stood,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Unfaithful shepherd, who for life alone</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">In ignominious safety, while the Church</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Had ever in its gladdest dream proposed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And here by agents unforeseen, and means</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beyond the scope of foresight brought about,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tolosan mountains, where the Almohade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld his myriads scatter’d and destroy’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like locusts swept before the stormy North!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou too, Salado, on that later day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Africa received her final foil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thy swoln stream incarnadined, roll’d back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The invaders to the deep, ... there shall they toss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till on their native Mauritanian shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waves shall cast their bones to whiten there.</div>

RODERICK AND RUSILLA.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When all had been perform’d, the royal Goth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look’d up towards the chamber in the tower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where gazing on the multitude below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alone Rusilla stood. He met her eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For it was singling him amid the crowd;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obeying then the hand which beckon’d him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He went with heart prepared, nor shrinking now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But arm’d with self-approving thoughts that hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entering in tremulous haste, he closed the door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turn’d to clasp her knees; but lo, she spread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her arms, and catching him in close embrace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell on his neck, and cried, My Son, my Son!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere long, controlling that first agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With effort of strong will, backward she bent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gazing on his head now shorn and grey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on his furrow’d countenance, exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still, still, my Roderick! the same noble mind!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The same heroic heart! Still, still, my Son; ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Changed, ... yet not wholly fallen, ... not wholly lost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He cried, ... not wholly in the sight of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unworthy, O my Mother, nor in thine!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She lock’d her arms again around his neck,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saying, Lord, let me now depart in peace!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bow’d her head again, and silently</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave way to tears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">When that first force was spent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And passion in exhaustment found relief, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I knew thee, said Rusilla, when the dog</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose from my feet, and lick’d his master’s hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All flash’d upon me then; the instinctive sense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That goes unerringly where reason fails, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The voice, the eye, ... a mother’s thoughts are quick, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Miraculous as it seem’d, ... Siverian’s tale, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Florinda’s, ... every action, ... every word, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each strengthening each, and all confirming all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reveal’d thee, O my Son! but I restrain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My heart, and yielded to thy holier will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thoughts which rose to tempt a soul not yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wean’d wholly from the world.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">What thoughts? replied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick. That I might see thee yet again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such as thou wert, she answer’d; not alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Heaven and me restored, but to thyself, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy Crown, ... thy Country, ... all within thy reach;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven so disposing all things, that the means</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which wrought the ill, might work the remedy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Methought I saw thee once again the hope, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The strength, ... the pride of Spain! The miracle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which I beheld made all things possible.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know the inconstant people how their mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With every breath of good or ill report,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fluctuates, like summer corn before the breeze;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quick in their hatred, quicker in their love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Generous and hasty, soon would they redress</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">All wrongs of former obloquy ... I thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of happiness restored, ... the broken heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heal’d, ... and Count Julian, for his daughter’s sake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turning in thy behalf against the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His powerful sword: ... all possibilities</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That could be found or fancied, built a dream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before me; such as easiest might illude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lofty spirit train’d in palaces,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And not alone amid the flatteries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of youth with thoughts of high ambition fed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all is sunshine, but through years of woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When sorrow sanctified their use, upheld</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By honourable pride and earthly hopes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thought I yet might nurse upon my knee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some young Theodofred, and see in him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy Father’s image and thine own renew’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And love to think the little hand which there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Play’d with the bauble, should in after days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wield the transmitted sceptre; ... that through him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ancient seed should be perpetuate, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That precious seed revered so long, desired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So dearly, and so wonderously preserved.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Nay, he replied, Heaven hath not with its bolts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scathed the proud summit of the tree, and left</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trunk unflaw’d; ne’er shall it clothe its boughs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Again, nor push again its scyons forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Head, root, and branch, all mortified alike!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long ere these locks were shorn had I cut off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thoughts of royalty! Time might renew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their growth, as for Manoah’s captive son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I too on the miscreant race, like him,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might prove my strength regenerate; but the hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When in its second best nativity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My soul was born again through grace, this heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Died to the world. Dreams such as thine pass now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like evening clouds before me; if I think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How beautiful they seem, ’tis but to feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How soon they fade, how fast the night shuts in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But in that World to which my hopes look on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Time enters not, nor Mutability;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beauty and goodness are unfading there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whatever there is given us to enjoy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That we enjoy for ever, still the same....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Much might Count Julian’s sword atchieve for Spain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And me, but more will his dear daughter’s soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Effect in Heaven; and soon will she be there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An Angel at the throne of Grace, to plead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his behalf and mine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">I knew thy heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She answer’d, and subdued the vain desire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was the World’s last effort. Thou hast chosen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The better part. Yes, Roderick, even on earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is a praise above the monarch’s fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A higher, holier, more enduring praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this will yet be thine!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">O tempt me not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mother! he cried; nor let ambition take</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That specious form to cheat us! What but this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fallen as I am, have I to offer Heaven?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ancestral sceptre, public fame, content</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of private life, the general good report,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Power, reputation, happiness, ... whate’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart of man desires to constitute</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">His earthly weal, ... unerring Justice claim’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In forfeiture. I with submitted soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bow to the righteous law and kiss the rod.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only while thus submitted, suffering thus, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only while offering up that name on earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps in trial offer’d to my choice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could I present myself before thy sight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus only could endure myself, or fix</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My thoughts upon that fearful pass, where Death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stands in the Gate of Heaven!... Time passes on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The healing work of sorrow is complete;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All vain desires have long been weeded out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All vain regrets subdued; the heart is dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soul is ripe and eager for her birth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bless me, my Mother! and come when it will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The inevitable hour, we die in peace.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">So saying, on her knees he bow’d his head;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She raised her hands to Heaven and blest her child;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then bending forward, as he rose, embraced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And claspt him to her heart, and cried, Once more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Theodofred, with pride behold thy son!</div>

THE MOORISH CAMP.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The times are big with tidings; every hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From east and west and south the breathless scouts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bring swift alarums in; the gathering foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Advancing from all quarters to one point,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close their wide crescent. Nor was aid of fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To magnify their numbers needed now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They came in myriads. Africa had pour’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fresh shoals upon the coast of wretched Spain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lured from their hungry deserts to the scene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of spoil, like vultures to the battle-field,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fierce, unrelenting, habited in crimes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like bidden guests the mirthful ruffians flock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To that free feast which in their Prophet’s name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rapine and Lust proclaim’d. Nor were the chiefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of victory less assured, by long success</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Elate, and proud of that o’erwhelming strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, surely they believed, as it had roll’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus far uncheck’d would roll victorious on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till, like the Orient, the subjected West</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should bow in reverence at Mahommed’s name;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pilgrims, from remotest Arctic shores,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tread with religious feet the burning sands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Araby, and Mecca’s stony soil.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proud of his part in Roderick’s overthrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their leader Abulcacem came, a man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Immitigable, long in war renown’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here Magued comes, who on the conquer’d walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Cordoba, by treacherous fear betray’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Planted the moony standard: Ibrahim here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, who by Genil and in Darro’s vales,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had for the Moors the fairest portion won</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all their spoils, fairest and best maintain’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the Alpuxarras given in trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His other name, through them preserved in song</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here too Alcahman, vaunting his late deeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At Auria, all her children by the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cut off, her bulwarks rased, her towers laid low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her dwellings by devouring flames consumed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bloody and hard of heart, he little ween’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vain-boastful chief! that from those fatal flames</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fire of retribution had gone forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which soon should wrap him round.</div>
    <div class="verse indent34">The renegades</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here too were seen, Ebba and Sisibert;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A spurious brood, but of their parent’s crimes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">True heirs, in guilt begotten, and in ill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Train’d up. The same unnatural rage that turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their swords against their country, made them seek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unmindful of their wretched mother’s end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo’s life. No enmity is like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Domestic hatred. For his blood they thirst,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if that sacrifice might satisfy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Witiza’s guilty ghost, efface the shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of their adulterous birth, and one crime more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crowning a hideous course, emancipate</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thenceforth their spirits from all earthly fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This was their only care; but other thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were rankling in that elder villain’s mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their kinsman Orpas, he of all the crew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who in this fatal visitation fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The foulest and the falsest wretch that e’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Renounced his baptism. From his cherish’d views</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of royalty cut off, he coveted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s wide domains, and hopeless now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To gain them through the daughter, laid his toils</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against the father’s life, ... the instrument</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his ambition first, and now design’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its victim. To this end with cautious hints,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At favouring season ventured, he possess’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The leader’s mind; then, subtly fostering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The doubts himself had sown, with bolder charge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bade him warily regard the Count,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest underneath an outward show of faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart uncircumcised were Christian still:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Else, wherefore had Florinda not obey’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her dear loved sire’s example, and embraced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The saving truth? Else, wherefore was her hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plighted to him so long, so long withheld,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till she had found a fitting hour to fly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With that audacious Prince, who now in arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Defied the Caliph’s power; ... for who could doubt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in his company she fled, perhaps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mover of his flight? What if the Count</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Himself had plann’d the evasion which he feign’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In sorrow to condemn? What if she went</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A pledge assured, to tell the mountaineers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That when they met the Musselmen in the heat</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fight, her father passing to their side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would draw the victory with him?... Thus he breathed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fiend-like in Abulcacem’s ear his schemes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of murderous malice; and the course of things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere long, in part approving his discourse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aided his aim, and gave his wishes weight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For scarce on the Asturian territory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had they set foot, when, with the speed of fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Eudon, nothing doubting that their force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would like a flood sweep all resistance down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hasten’d to plead his merits; ... he alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Found faithful in obedience through reproach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And danger, when the madden’d multitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurried their chiefs along, and high and low</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With one infectious frenzy seized, provoked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The invincible in arms. Pelayo led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The raging crew, ... he doubtless the prime spring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all these perilous movements; and ’twas said</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He brought the assurance of a strong support,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s aid, for in his company</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Cordoba, Count Julian’s daughter came.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus Eudon spake before the assembled chiefs;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When instantly a stern and wrathful voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied, I know Pelayo never made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That senseless promise! He who raised the tale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lies foully; but the bitterest enemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That ever hunted for Pelayo’s life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath never with the charge of falsehood touch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">The Baron had not recognized</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till then, beneath the turban’s shadowing folds,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Julian’s swart visage, where the fiery skies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Africa, through many a year’s long course,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had set their hue inburnt. Something he sought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In quick excuse to say of common fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lightly believed and busily diffused,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that no enmity had moved his speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repeating rumour’s tale. Julian replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Eudon, neither for thyself nor me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Excuse is needed here. The path I tread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is one wherein there can be no return.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No pause, no looking back! A choice like mine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For time and for eternity is made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once and for ever! and as easily</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The breath of vain report might build again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The throne which my just vengeance overthrew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in the Caliph and his Captain’s mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Affect the opinion of my well-tried truth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tidings which thou givest me of my child</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Touch me more vitally; bad though they be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A secret apprehension of aught worse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes me with joy receive them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">Then the Count</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Abulcacem turn’d his speech, and said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pray thee, Chief, give me a messenger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By whom I may to this unhappy child</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dispatch a father’s bidding, such as yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May win her back. What I would say requires</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No veil of privacy; before ye all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The errand shall be given.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Boldly he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet wary in that show of open truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For well he knew what dangers girt him round</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the faithless race. Blind with revenge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For them in madness had he sacrificed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His name, his baptism, and his native land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To feel, still powerful as he was, that life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung on their jealous favour. But his heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approved him now, where love, too long restrain’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resumed its healing influence, leading him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Right on with no misgiving. Chiefs, he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear me, and let your wisdom judge between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Me and Prince Orpas!... Known it is to all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too well, what mortal injury provoked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My spirit to that vengeance which your aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So signally hath given. A covenant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We made when first our purpose we combined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he should have Florinda for his wife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My only child, so should she be, I thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Revenged and honour’d best. My word was given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Truly, nor did I cease to use all means</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of counsel or command, entreating her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sometimes with tears, seeking sometimes with threats</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of an offended father’s curse to enforce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obedience; that, she said, the Christian law</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forbade, moreover she had vow’d herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A servant to the Lord. In vain I strove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To win her to the Prophet’s saving faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Using perhaps a rigour to that end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beyond permitted means, and to my heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which loved her dearer than its own life-blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Abhorrent. Silently she suffer’d all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or when I urged her with most vehemence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only replied, I knew her fix’d resolve,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And craved my patience but a little while</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till death should set her free. Touch’d as I was,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I yet persisted, till at length to escape</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ceaseless importunity, she fled:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And verily I fear’d until this hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My rigour to some fearfuller resolve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than flight, had driven my child. Chiefs, I appeal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To each and all, and Orpas to thyself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Especially, if, having thus essay’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All means that law and nature have allow’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bend her will, I may not rightfully</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hold myself free, that promise being void</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which cannot be fulfill’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Thou sayest then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orpas replied, that from her false belief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her stubborn opposition drew its force.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I should have thought that from the ways corrupt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of these idolatrous Christians, little care</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might have sufficed to wean a duteous child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The example of a parent so beloved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leading the way; and yet I will not doubt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou didst enforce with all sincerity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And holy zeal upon thy daughter’s mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The truths of Islam.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Julian knit his brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And scowling on the insidious renegade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He answer’d, By what reasoning my poor mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was from the old idolatry reclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None better knows than Seville’s mitred chief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who first renouncing errors which he taught,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Led me his follower to the Prophet’s pale.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy lessons I repeated as I could;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of graven images, unnatural vows,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">False records, fabling creeds, and juggling priests,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who making sanctity the cloak of sin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laugh’d at the fools on whose credulity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They fatten’d. To these arguments, whose worth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prince Orpas, least of all men, should impeach,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I added, like a soldier bred in arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the subtleties of schools unused,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The flagrant fact, that Heaven with victory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where’er they turn’d, attested and approved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chosen Prophet’s arms. If thou wert still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mitred Metropolitan, and I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some wretch of Arian or of Hebrew race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy proper business then might be to pry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And question me for lurking flaws of faith.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We Musselmen, Prince Orpas, live beneath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A wiser law, which with the iniquities</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of thine old craft, hath abrogated this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its foulest practice!</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">As Count Julian ceased,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From underneath his black and gather’d brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There went a look, which with these wary words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bore to the heart of that false renegade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their whole envenom’d meaning. Haughtily</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Withdrawing then his alter’d eyes, he said</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too much of this! return we to the sum</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of my discourse. Let Abulcacem say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In whom the Caliph speaks, if with all faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Having essay’d in vain all means to win</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My child’s consent, I may not hold henceforth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The covenant discharged.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">The Moor replied.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well hast thou said, and rightly may’st assure</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy daughter that the Prophet’s holy law</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forbids compulsion. Give thine errand now;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The messenger is here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Then Julian said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go to Pelayo, and from him entreat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Admittance to my child, where’er she be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say to her, that her father solemnly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Annuls the covenant with Orpas pledged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor with solicitations, nor with threats,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will urge her more, nor from that liberty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of faith restrain her, which the Prophet’s law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Liberal as Heaven from whence it came, to all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indulges. Tell her that her father says</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His days are number’d, and beseeches her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By that dear love, which from her infancy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still he hath borne her, growing as she grew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nursed in our weal and strengthen’d in our woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She will not in the evening of his life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leave him forsaken and alone. Enough</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sorrow, tell her, have her injuries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought on her father’s head; let not her act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus aggravate the burden. Tell her too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That when he pray’d her to return, he wept</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Profusely as a child; but bitterer tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than ever fell from childhood’s eyes, were those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which traced his hardy cheeks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">With faltering voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He spake, and after he had ceased from speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His lip was quivering still. The Moorish chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then to the messenger his bidding gave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say, cried he, to these rebel infidels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus Abulcacem in the Caliph’s name</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exhorteth them: Repent and be forgiven!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor think to stop the dreadful storm of war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which conquering and to conquer must fulfil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its destined circle, rolling eastward now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Back from the subjugated west, to sweep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrones and dominions down, till in the bond</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of unity all nations join, and Earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Acknowledge, as she sees one Sun in heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One God, one Chief, one Prophet, and one Law.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jerusalem, the holy City, bows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To holier Mecca’s creed; the Crescent shines</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Triumphant o’er the eternal pyramids;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the cold altars of the worshippers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Fire, moss grows, and reptiles leave their slime;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The African idolatries are fallen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Europe’s senseless gods of stone and wood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have had their day. Tell these misguided men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moment for repentance yet is left,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mercy the submitted neck will spare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the sword is drawn: but once unsheath’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Auria witness how that dreadful sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Accomplisheth its work! They little know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moors who hope in battle to withstand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their valour, or in flight escape their rage!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid our deserts we hunt down the birds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of heaven, ... wings do not save them! Nor shall rocks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And holds, and fastnesses, avail to save</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These mountaineers. Is not the Earth the Lord’s?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we, his chosen people, whom he sends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To conquer and possess it in his name?</div>

THE FOUNTAIN IN THE FOREST.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The second eve had closed upon their march</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within the Asturian border, and the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had pitch’d their tents amid an open wood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the mountain side. As day grew dim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their scatter’d fires shone with distincter light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the trees, above whose top the smoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diffused itself, and stain’d the evening sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere long the stir of occupation ceased,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the murmur of the busy host</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Subsiding died away, as through the camp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crier from a knoll proclaim’d the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For prayer appointed, and with sonorous voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice in melodious modulation full,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pronounced the highest name. There is no God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But God, he cried; there is no God but God!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mahommed is the Prophet of the Lord!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come ye to prayer! to prayer! The Lord is great!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no God but God!... Thus he pronounced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His ritual form, mingling with holiest truth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The audacious name accurst. The multitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made their ablutions in the mountain stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obedient, then their faces to the earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bent in formality of easy prayer.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">An arrow’s flight above that mountain stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a little glade, where underneath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A long smooth mossy stone a fountain rose.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An oak grew near, and with its ample boughs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’ercanopied the spring; its fretted roots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Emboss’d the bank, and on their tufted bark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grew plants which love the moisture and the shade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Short ferns, and longer leaves of wrinkled green</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which bent toward the spring, and when the wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made itself felt, just touch’d with gentle dip</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glassy surface, ruffled ne’er but then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save when a bubble rising from the depth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Burst, and with faintest circles mark’d its place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or if an insect skimm’d it with its wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or when in heavier drops the gather’d rain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell from the oak’s high bower. The mountain roe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, having drank there, he would bound across,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drew up upon the bank his meeting feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And put forth half his force. With silent lapse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From thence through mossy banks the water stole,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then murmuring hastened to the glen below.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diana might have loved in that sweet spot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take her noontide rest; and when she stoopt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hot from the chase to drink, well pleased had seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her own bright crescent, and the brighter face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It crown’d, reflected there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Beside that spring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s tent was pitch’d upon the glade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There his ablutions Moor-like he perform’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Moor-like knelt in prayer, bowing his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the mossy bank. There was a sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of voices at the tent when he arose,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo! with hurried step a woman came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward him; rightly then his heart presaged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ere he could behold her countenance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Florinda knelt, and with uplifted arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embraced her sire. He raised her from the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kiss’d her, and claspt her to his heart, and said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast not then forsaken me, my child!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howe’er the inexorable will of Fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May in the world which is to come, divide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our everlasting destinies, in this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wilt not, O my child, abandon me!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then with deep and interrupted voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor seeking to restrain his copious tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My blessing be upon thy head, he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A father’s blessing! Though all faiths were false,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It should not lose its worth!... She lock’d her hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Around his neck, and gazing in his face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through streaming tears, exclaim’d, Oh never more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here or hereafter, never let us part!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And breathing then a prayer in silence forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The name of Jesus trembled on her tongue.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Whom hast thou there? cried Julian, and drew back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeing that near them stood a meagre man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In humble garb, who rested with raised hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On a long staff, bending his head like one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who when he hears the distant vesper-bell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Halts by the way, and, all unseen of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Offers his homage in the eye of Heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She answered, Let not my dear father frown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In anger on his child! Thy messenger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Told me that I should be restrain’d no more</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">From liberty of faith, which the new law</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indulged to all; how soon my hour might come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I knew not, and although that hour will bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Few terrors, yet methinks I would not be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without a Christian comforter in death.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">A Priest! exclaimed the Count, and drawing back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stoopt for his turban that he might not lack</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some outward symbol of apostacy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For still in war his wonted arms he wore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor for the scymitar had changed the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Accustomed to his hand. He covered now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His short grey hair, and under the white folds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His swarthy brow, which gather’d as he rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Darken’d. Oh frown not thus! Florinda said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A kind and gentle counsellor is this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One who pours balm into a wounded soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mitigates the griefs he cannot heal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I told him I had vow’d to pass my days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A servant of the Lord, yet that my heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hearing the message of thy love, was drawn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With powerful yearnings back. Follow thy heart, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It answers to the call of duty here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, nor canst thou better serve the Lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than at thy father’s side.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Count Julian’s brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While thus she spake, insensibly relax’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Priest, cried he, and thus with even hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Weigh vows and natural duty in the scale?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In what old heresy hath he been train’d?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or in what wilderness hath he escaped</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The domineering Prelate’s fire and sword?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come hither, man, and tell me who thou art!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">A sinner, Roderick, drawing nigh, replied;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought to repentance by the grace of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And trusting for forgiveness through the blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Christ in humble hope.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">A smile of scorn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Julian assumed, but merely from the lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It came; for he was troubled while he gazed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the strong countenance and thoughtful eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before him. A new law hath been proclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said he, which overthrows in its career</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Christian altars of idolatry.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What think’st thou of the Prophet?... Roderick</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made answer, I am in the Moorish camp,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he who asketh is a Musselman.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How then should I reply?... Safely, rejoin’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The renegade, and freely may’st thou speak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To all that Julian asks. Is not the yoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Mecca easy, and its burden light?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spain hath not found it so, the Goth replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And groaning, turn’d away his countenance.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Count Julian knit his brow, and stood awhile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Regarding him with meditative eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silence. Thou art honest too! he cried;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why ’twas in quest of such a man as this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the old Grecian search’d by lantern light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In open day the city’s crowded streets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So rare he deem’d the virtue. Honesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sense of natural duty in a Priest!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now for a miracle, ye Saints of Spain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shall not pry too closely for the wires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, seeing what I see, ye have me now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the believing mood!</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">O blessed Saints,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Florinda cried, ’tis from the bitterness,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Hear him! and in your goodness give the scoff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The virtue of a prayer! So saying, she raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her hands in fervent action claspt to Heaven:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then as, still claspt, they fell, toward her sire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She turn’d her eyes, beholding him through tears.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The look, the gesture, and that silent woe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soften’d her father’s heart, which in this hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was open to the influences of love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Priest, thy vocation were a blessed one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Julian, if its mighty power were used</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lessen human misery, not to swell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mournful sum, already all-too-great.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If, as thy former counsel should imply,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art not one who would for his craft’s sake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fret with corrosives and inflame the wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which the poor sufferer brings to thee in trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thou with virtuous balm will bind it up, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If, as I think, thou art not one of those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose villainy makes honest men turn Moors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou then wilt answer with unbiass’d mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What I shall ask thee, and exorcise thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sick and feverish conscience of my child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From inbred phantoms, fiend-like, which possess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her innocent spirit. Children we are all</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">That creeds like colours being but accident,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A prayer, from whatsoever lips it flow,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For healing? Thou hast turn’d away from Him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who saith, Forgive as ye would be forgiven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that the Moorish sword might do thy work,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The cup was sweet: but it hath left behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A bitter relish! Gladly would thy soul</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Danger, remorse, and stinging obloquy?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One only hope, one only remedy,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus Roderick spake, and spread his arms as if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He offer’d to the sword his willing breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With looks of passionate persuasion fix’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the Count, who in his first access</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of anger, seem’d as though he would have call’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His guards to seize the Priest. The attitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disarm’d him, and that fervent zeal sincere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And more than both, the look and voice, which like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mystery troubled him. Florinda too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung on his arm with both her hands, and cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O father, wrong him not! he speaks from God!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life and salvation are upon his tongue!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Judge thou the value of that faith whereby,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reflecting on the past, I murmur not,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the end of all look on with joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of hope assured!</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Peace, innocent! replied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Count, and from her hold withdrew his arm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then with a gather’d brow of mournfulness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rather than wrath, regarding Roderick, said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou preachest that all sins may be effaced:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is there forgiveness, Christian, in thy creed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Roderick’s crime?... For Roderick and for thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian, said the Goth, and as he spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trembled through every fibre of his frame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gate of Heaven is open. Julian threw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wrathful hand aloft, and cried, Away!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth could not hold us both, nor can one Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Contain my deadliest enemy and me!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">My father, say not thus! Florinda cried;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have forgiven him! I have pray’d for him!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For him, for thee, and for myself I pour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One constant prayer to Heaven! In passion then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She knelt, and bending back, with arms and face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raised toward the sky, the supplicant exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Redeemer, heal his heart! It is the grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which festers there that hath bewilder’d him!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save him, Redeemer! by thy precious death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save, save him, O my God! Then on her face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She fell, and thus with bitterness pursued</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silent throes her agonizing prayer.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Afflict not thus thyself, my child, the Count</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exclaim’d; O dearest, be thou comforted;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Set but thy heart at rest, I ask no more!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peace dearest, peace!... and weeping as he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He knelt to raise her. Roderick also knelt;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be comforted, he cried, and rest in faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That God will hear thy prayers! they must be heard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He who could doubt the worth of prayers like thine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May doubt of all things! Sainted as thou art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In sufferings here, this miracle will be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy work and thy reward!</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Then raising her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They seated her upon the fountain’s brink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there beside her sate. The moon had risen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that fair spring lay blackened half in shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half like a burnish’d mirror in her light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By that reflected light Count Julian saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Roderick’s face was bathed with tears, and pale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As monumental marble. Friend, said he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether thy faith be fabulous, or sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indeed from Heaven, its dearest gift to man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy heart is true: and had the mitred Priest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Seville been like thee, or hadst thou held</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The place he fill’d; ... but this is idle talk, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Things are as they will be; and we, poor slaves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fret in the harness as we may, must drag</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Car of Destiny where’er she drives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inexorable and blind!</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Oh wretched man!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cried Roderick, if thou seekest to assuage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy wounded spirit with that deadly drug,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hell’s subtlest venom; look to thine own heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where thou hast Will and Conscience to belie</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This juggling sophistry, and lead thee yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through penitence to Heaven!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
    <div class="verse indent28">Whate’er it be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That governs us, in mournful tone the Count</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied, Fate, Providence, or Allah’s will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or reckless Fortune, still the effect the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A world of evil and of misery!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look where we will we meet it; wheresoe’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We go we bear it with us. Here we sit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the margin of this peaceful spring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And oh! what volumes of calamity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would be unfolded here, if either heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laid open its sad records! Tell me not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of goodness! Either in some freak of power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This frame of things was fashion’d, then cast off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take its own wild course, the sport of chance;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the bad Spirit o’er the Good prevails,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The happiest child of earth that e’er was mark’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be the minion of prosperity,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! who could bear the haunting mystery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If death and retribution did not solve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The riddle, and to heavenliest harmony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reduce the seeming chaos!... Here we see</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The water at its well-head; clear it is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not more transpicuous the invisible air;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pure as an infant’s thoughts; and here to life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And good directed all its uses serve.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The herb grows greener on its brink; sweet flowers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bend o’er the stream that feeds their freshened roots;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The red-breast loves it for his wintry haunts;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the buds begin to open forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Builds near it with his mate their brooding nest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thirsty stag with widening nostrils there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Invigorated draws his copious draught;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there amid its flags the wild-boar stands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor suffering wrong nor meditating hurt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through woodlands wild and solitary fields</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unsullied thus it holds its bounteous course;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when it reaches the resorts of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The service of the city there defiles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tainted stream; corrupt and foul it flows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through loathsome banks and o’er a bed impure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till in the sea, the appointed end to which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all its way it hastens, ’tis received,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, losing all pollution, mingles there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the wide world of waters. So is it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the great stream of things, if all were seen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good the beginning, good the end shall be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And transitory evil only make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The good end happier. Ages pass away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrones fall, and nations disappear, and worlds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grow old and go to wreck; the soul alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Endures, and what she chuseth for herself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The arbiter of her own destiny</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Replied, Repentance taketh sin away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Death remedies the rest.... Soothed by the strain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of such discourse, Julian was silent then,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Was calm’d: If sore experience may be thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To teach the uses of adversity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, alas! who better learn’d than I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that sad school! Methinks if ye would know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How visitations of calamity</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And deem’d the deep opake would blot her beams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, melting like a wreath of snow, it hangs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In folds of wavey silver round, and clothes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The orb with richer beauties than her own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then passing, leaves her in her light serene.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Thus having said, the pious sufferer sate,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The broken moonbeams. They too by the toil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of spirit, as by travail of the day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Subdued, were silent, yielding to the hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The silver cloud diffusing slowly past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now into its airy elements</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resolved is gone; while through the azure depth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alone in heaven the glorious Moon pursues</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her course appointed, with indifferent beams</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shining upon the silent hills around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the dark tents of that unholy host,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, all unconscious of impending fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take their last slumber there. The camp is still;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fires have mouldered, and the breeze which stirs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soft and snowy embers, just lays bare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At times a red and evanescent light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or for a moment wakes a feeble flame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They by the fountain hear the stream below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose murmurs, as the wind arose or fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fuller or fainter reach the ear attuned.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now the nightingale, not distant far,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Began her solitary song; and pour’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the cold moon a richer, stronger strain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than that with which the lyric lark salutes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The new-born day. Her deep and thrilling song</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seem’d with its piercing melody to reach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soul, and in mysterious unison</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blend with all thoughts of gentleness and love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their hearts were open to the healing power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of nature; and the splendour of the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The flow of waters, and that sweetest lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came to them like a copious evening dew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falling on vernal herbs which thirst for rain.</div>

THE MOORISH COUNCIL.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus they beside the fountain sate, of food</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rest forgetful, when a messenger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Summon’d Count Julian to the Leader’s tent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In council there at that late hour he found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The assembled Chiefs, on sudden tidings call’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of unexpected weight from Cordoba.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jealous that Abdalazis had assumed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A regal state, affecting in his court</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The forms of Gothic sovereignty, the Moors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom artful spirits of ambitious mould</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stirr’d up, had risen against him in revolt:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he who late had in the Caliph’s name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ruled from the Ocean to the Pyrenees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mutilate and headless carcase now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From pitying hands received beside the road</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hasty grave, scarce hidden there from dogs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ravens, nor from wintry rains secure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She, too, who in the wreck of Spain preserved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her queenly rank, the wife of Roderick first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Abdalazis after, and to both</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alike unhappy, shared the ruin now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her counsels had brought on; for she had led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The infatuate Moor, in dangerous vauntery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To these aspiring forms, ... so should he gain</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Respect and honour from the Musselmen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, and that the obedience of the Goths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Follow’d the sceptre. In an evil hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She gave the counsel, and in evil hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He lent a willing ear; the popular rage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell on them both; and they to whom her name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had been a mark for mockery and reproach,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shudder’d with human horror at her fate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ayub was heading the wild anarchy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But where the cement of authority</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is wanting, all things there are dislocate:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mutinous soldiery, by every cry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rumour set in wild career, were driven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By every gust of passion, setting up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One hour, what in the impulse of the next,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Equally unreasoning, they destroy’d: thus all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was in misrule where uproar gave the law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ere from far Damascus they could learn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Caliph’s pleasure, many a moon must pass.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What should be done? should Abulcacem march</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Cordoba, and in the Caliph’s name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assume the power which to his rank in arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rightly devolved, restoring thus the reign</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of order? or pursue with quicken’d speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The end of this great armament, and crush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rebellion first, then to domestic ills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apply his undivided mind and force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Victorious? What in this emergency</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was Julian’s counsel, Abulcacem ask’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should they accomplish soon their enterprize?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or would the insurgent infidels prolong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The contest, seeking by protracted war</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To weary them, and trusting in the strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of these wild hills?</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Julian replied, The Chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of this revolt is wary, resolute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of approved worth in war: a desperate part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He for himself deliberately hath chosen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Confiding in the hereditary love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Borne to him by these hardy mountaineers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A love which his own noble qualities</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have strengthen’d so that every heart is his.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When ye can bring them to the open proof</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of battle, ye will find them in his cause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lavish of life; but well they know the strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of their own fastnesses, the mountain paths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impervious to pursuit, the vantages</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rock, and pass, and woodland, and ravine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hardly will ye tempt them to forego</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These natural aids wherein they put their trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in their stubborn spirit, each alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deem’d by themselves invincible, and so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Roman found and Goth ... beneath whose sway</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slowly persuaded rather than subdued</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They came, and still through every change retain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their manners obstinate and barbarous speech.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My counsel, therefore, is, that we secure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With strong increase of force the adjacent posts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And chiefly Gegio, leaving them so mann’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As may abate the hope of enterprize</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their strength being told. Time in a strife like this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Becomes the ally of those who trust in him:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make then with Time your covenant. Old feuds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May disunite the chiefs: some may be gain’d</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">By fair entreaty, others by the stroke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of nature, or of policy, cut off.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This was the counsel which in Cordoba</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I offer’d Abdalazis: in ill hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rejecting it, he sent upon this war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His father’s faithful friend! Dark are the ways</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of destiny! had I been at his side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old Muza would not now have mourn’d his age</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Left childless, nor had Ayub dared defy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Caliph’s represented power. The case</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calls for thine instant presence, with the weight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of thy legitimate authority.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Julian said Orpas, turning from beneath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His turban to the Count a crafty eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy daughter is return’d; doth she not bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some tidings of the movements of the foe?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Count replied, When child and parent meet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First reconciled from discontents which wrung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hearts of both, ill should their converse be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of warlike matters! There hath been no time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For such enquiries, neither should I think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ask her touching that for which I know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She hath neither eye nor thought.</div>
    <div class="verse indent34">There was a time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orpas with smile malignant thus replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When in the progress of the Caliph’s arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s daughter had an interest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which touch’d her nearly! But her turn is served,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hatred of Prince Orpas may beget</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indifference to the cause. Yet Destiny</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still guideth to the service of the faith</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wayward heart of woman; for as one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Delivered Roderick to the avenging sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So hath another at this hour betray’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo to his fall. His sister came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At nightfall to my tent a fugitive.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She tells me that on learning our approach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rebel to a cavern in the hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had sent his wife and children, and with them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those of his followers, thinking there conceal’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They might be safe. She, moved, by injuries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which stung her spirit, on the way escaped,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for revenge will guide us. In reward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She asks her brother’s forfeiture of lands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In marriage with Numacian: something too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Touching his life, that for her services</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It might be spared, she said; ... an after-thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To salve decorum, and if conscience wake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Serve as a sop: but when the sword shall smite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo and his dangerous race, I ween</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That a thin kerchief will dry all the tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lady Guisla sheds!</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">’Tis the old taint!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Julian mournfully; from her mother’s womb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She brought the inbred wickedness which now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In ripe infection blossoms. Woman, woman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still to the Goths art thou the instrument</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of overthrow; thy virtue and thy vice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fatal alike to them!</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Say rather, cried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The insidious renegade, that Allah thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By woman punisheth the idolatry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of those who raise a woman to the rank</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of godhead, calling on their Mary’s name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With senseless prayers. In vain shall they invoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her trusted succour now! like silly birds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By fear betray’d, they fly into the toils;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this Pelayo, who in lengthen’d war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Baffling our force, has thought perhaps to reign</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prince of the Mountains, when we hold his wife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And offspring at our mercy, must himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come to the lure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">Enough, the Leader said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This unexpected work of favouring Fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opens an easy way to our desires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And renders farther counsel needless now.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great is the Prophet whose protecting power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Goes with the faithful forth! the rebels’ days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are number’d; Allah hath deliver’d them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into our hands!</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">So saying he arose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Chiefs withdrew, Orpas alone remain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obedient to his indicated will.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The event, said Abulcacem, hath approved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy judgement in all points; his daughter comes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the first summons, even as thou saidst;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her errand with the insurgents done, she brings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their well-concerted project back, a safe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And unexpected messenger; ... the Moor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shallow Moor, ... must see and not perceive;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must hear and understand not; yea must bear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor easy fool, to serve their after mirth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A part in his own undoing! But just Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With this unlook’d-for incident hath marr’d</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their complots, and the sword shall cut this web</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of treason.</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Well, the renegade replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou knowest Count Julian’s spirit, quick in wiles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In act audacious. Baffled now, he thinks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Either by instant warning to apprize</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rebels of their danger, or preserve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hostages when fallen into our power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till secret craft contrive, or open force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Win their enlargement. Haply too he dreams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Cordoba, the avenger and the friend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Abdalazis, in that cause to arm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moor against Moor, preparing for himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The victory o’er the enfeebled conquerors.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Success in treason hath embolden’d him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And power but serves him for fresh treachery, false</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Roderick first, and to the Caliph now.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">The guilt, said Abulcacem, is confirm’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sentence past; all that is now required</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is to strike sure and safely. He hath with him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A veteran force devoted to his will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom to provoke were perilous; nor less</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of peril lies there in delay: what course</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Between these equal dangers should we steer?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">They have been train’d beneath him in the wars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Africa, the renegade replied;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Men are they who, from their youth up, have found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their occupation and their joy in arms;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indifferent to the cause for which they fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But faithful to their leader, who hath won</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By licence largely given, yet temper’d still</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With exercise of firm authority,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their whole devotion. Vainly should we seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By proof of Julian’s guilt to pacify</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such martial spirits, unto whom all creeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And countries are alike; but take away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The head, and forthwith their fidelity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Goes at the market price. The act must be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sudden and secret; poison is too slow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus it may best be done; the Mountaineers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doubtless, ere long will rouse us with some spur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sudden enterprise: at such a time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A trusty minister approaching him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May smite him, so that all shall think the spear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comes from the hostile troops.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">Right counsellor!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cried Abulcacem, thou shalt have his lands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The proper meed of thy fidelity:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His daughter thou may’st take or leave. Go now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And find a faithful instrument to put</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our purpose in effect!... And when ’tis done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moor, as Orpas from the tent withdrew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Muttering pursued, ... look for a like reward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thyself! that restless head of wickedness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the grave will brood no treasons. Other babes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scream when the Devil, as they spring to life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Infects them with his touch; but thou didst stretch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine arms to meet him, and like mother’s milk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suck the congenial evil! Thou hast tried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both laws, and were there aught to gain, wouldst prove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A third as readily; but when thy sins</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are weigh’d, ’twill be against an empty scale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And neither Prophet will avail thee then!</div>

THE VALE OF COVADONGA.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The camp is stirring, and ere day hath dawn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tents are struck. Early they rise whom hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awakens, and they travel fast with whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She goes companion of the way. By noon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath Abulcacem in his speed attain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vale of Cangas. Well the trusty scouts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observe his march, and fleet as mountain roes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From post to post with instantaneous speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warning bear: none else is nigh; the vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath been deserted, and Pelayo’s hall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is open to the foe, who on the tower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hoist their white signal-flag. In Sella’s stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The misbelieving multitudes perform,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With hot and hasty hand, their noontide rite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then hurryingly repeat the Impostor’s prayer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here they divide; the Chieftain halts with half</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Whom where the valley widen’d he disposed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Liable to first attack, that so the deed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Proud of Granada’s snowy heights subdued,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">In dens and rocky fastnesses, how close</div>

    <div class="verse indent20">There can be no escape</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For those who in the cave seek shelter, cried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alcahman; yield they must, or from their holes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like bees we smoke them out. The Chief perhaps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May reign awhile King of the wolves and bears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till his own subjects hunt him down, or kites</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And crows divide what hunger may have left</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his ghastly limbs. Happier for him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That destiny should this day to our hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deliver him; short would be his sufferings then;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we right joyfully should in one hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold our work accomplish’d, and his race</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Extinct.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Thus these in mockery and in thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of bloody triumph, to the future blind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indulged the scornful vein; nor deem’d that they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom to the sword’s unsparing edge they doom’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even then in joyful expectation pray’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Heaven for their approach, and at their post</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prepared, were trembling with excess of hope.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here in these mountain straits the Mountaineer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had felt his country’s strength insuperable;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here he had pray’d to see the Musselman</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all his myriads; therefore had he look’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Covadonga as a sanctuary</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apt for concealment, easy of defence;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Guisla’s flight, though to his heart it sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A pang more poignant for their mother’s sake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet did it further in its consequence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hope and project, surer than decoy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well-laid, or best-concerted stratagem.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sullen and revengeful mind, he knew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would follow to the extremity of guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its long fore-purposed shame: the toils were laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she who by the Musselmen full sure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thought on her kindred her revenge to wreak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Led the Moors in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">Count Pedro and his son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were hovering with the main Asturian force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the wider vale to watch occasion there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with hot onset when the alarm began</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pursue the vantage. In the fated straits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Deva had the King disposed the rest:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the hanging woods, and on the cliffs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A long mile’s length on either side its bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They lay. The lever and the axe and saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had skilfully been plied; and trees and stones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A dread artillery, ranged on crag and shelf</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And steep descent, were ready at the word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Precipitate to roll resistless down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The faithful maiden not more wistfully</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looks for the day that brings her lover home; ...</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce more impatiently the horse endures</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rein, when loud and shrill the hunter’s horn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rings in his joyous ears, than at their post</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Mountaineers await their certain prey;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet mindful of their Prince’s order, oft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And solemnly enforced, with eagerness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Subdued by minds well-master’d, they expect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The appointed signal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Hand must not be raised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Foot stirr’d, nor voice be utter’d, said the Chief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the word pass: impatience would mar all.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God hath deliver’d over to your hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His enemies and ours, so we but use</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The occasion wisely. Not till the word pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From man to man transmitted, “In the name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of God, for Spain and Vengeance!” let a hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be lifted; on obedience all depends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their march below with noise of horse and foot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And haply with the clang of instruments,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might drown all other signal, this is sure;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But wait it calmly; it will not be given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the whole line hath enter’d in the toils.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comrades, be patient, so shall none escape</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who once set foot within these straits of death.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus had Pelayo on the Mountaineers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With frequent and impressive charge enforced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The needful exhortation. This alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He doubted, that the Musselmen might see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The perils of the vale, and warily</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forbear to enter. But they thought to find,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As Guisla told, the main Asturian force</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeking concealment there, no other aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soliciting from these their native hills;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that the babes and women having fallen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In thraldom, they would lay their weapons down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And supplicate forgiveness for their sake.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor did the Moors perceive in what a strait</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They enter’d; for the morn had risen o’ercast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the Sun had reach’d the height of heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dimly his pale and beamless orb was seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moving through mist. A soft and gentle rain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce heavier than the summer’s evening dew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Descended, ... through so still an atmosphere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That every leaf upon the moveless trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was studded o’er with rain-drops, bright and full,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None falling till from its own weight o’erswoln</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The motion came.</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Low on the mountain side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fleecey vapour hung, and in its veil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all their dreadful preparations wrapt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Mountaineers; ... in breathless hope they lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some blessing God in silence for the power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day vouchsafed; others with fervency</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of prayer and vow invoked the Mother-Maid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beseeching her that in this favouring hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She would be strongly with them. From below</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime distinct they heard the passing tramp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of horse and foot, continuous as the sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Deva’s stream, and barbarous tongues commixt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With laughter, and with frequent shouts, ... for all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exultant came, expecting sure success;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But of the women, all whom with the babes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maternal care detain’d not, were aloft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To aid in the destruction; by the side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fathers, brethren, husbands, station’d there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They watch and pray. Pelayo in the cave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the venerable primate took his post.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ranged on the rising cliffs on either hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vigilant sentinels with eye intent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observe his movements, when to take the word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pass it forward. He in arms complete</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stands in the portal: a stern majesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reign’d in his countenance severe that hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in his eye a deep and dreadful joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shone, as advancing up the vale he saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moorish banners. God hath blinded them!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said; the measure of their crimes is full!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Vale of Deva, famous shalt thou be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From this day forth for ever; and to these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy springs shall unborn generations come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In pilgrimage, and hallow with their prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The cradle of their native monarchy!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">There was a stirring in the air, the sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prevail’d, and gradually the brightening mist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Began to rise and melt. A jutting crag</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the right projected o’er the stream,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not farther from the cave than a strong hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Expert, with deadly aim, might cast the spear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or a strong voice, pitch’d to full compass, make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its clear articulation heard distinct.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A venturous dalesman, once ascending there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rob the eagle’s nest, had fallen, and hung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the heather, wonderously preserved:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore had he with pious gratitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Placed on that overhanging brow a Cross,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tall as the mast of some light fisher’s skiff,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from the vale conspicuous. As the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Advanced, the Chieftain in the van was seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Known by his arms, and from the crag a voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pronounced his name, ... Alcahman! hoa, look up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alcahman! As the floating mist drew up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It had divided there, and open’d round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Cross; part clinging to the rock beneath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hovering and waving part in fleecey folds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A canopy of silver light condensed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To shape and substance. In the midst there stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A female form, one hand upon the Cross,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The other raised in menacing act; below</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loose flow’d her raiment, but her breast was arm’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And helmeted her head. The Moor turn’d pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For on the walls of Auria he had seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That well-known figure, and had well believed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She rested with the dead. What, hoa! she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alcahman! In the name of all who fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At Auria in the massacre, this hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I summon thee before the throne of God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To answer for the innocent blood! This hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moor, Miscreant, Murderer, Child of Hell, this hour</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">I summon thee to judgement!... In the name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of God! for Spain and Vengeance!</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">Thus she closed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her speech; for taking from the Primate’s hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That oaken cross which at the sacring rites</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had served for crosier, at the cavern’s mouth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo lifted it and gave the word.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From voice to voice on either side it pass’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With rapid repetition, ... In the name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of God! for Spain and Vengeance! and forthwith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On either side along the whole defile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Asturians shouting in the name of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Set the whole ruin loose! huge trunks and stones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And loosen’d crags, down down they roll’d with rush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bound, and thundering force. Such was the fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As when some city by the labouring earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaved from its strong foundations is cast down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all its dwellings, towers, and palaces,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In one wide desolation prostrated.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From end to end of that long strait, the crash</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was heard continuous, and commixt with sounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More dreadful, shrieks of horror and despair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And death, ... the wild and agonizing cry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that whole host in one destruction whelm’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vain was all valour there, all martial skill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The valiant arm is helpless now; the feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swift in the race avail not now to save;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They perish, all their thousands perish there, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Horsemen and infantry they perish all, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The outward armour and the bones within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Broken and bruised and crush’d. Echo prolong’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long uproar: a silence then ensued,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through which the sound of Deva’s stream was heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lonely voice of waters, wild and sweet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lingering groan, the faintly-utter’d prayer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The louder curses of despairing death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ascended not so high. Down from the cave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo hastes, the Asturians hasten down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fierce and immitigable down they speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On all sides, and along the vale of blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The avenging sword did mercy’s work that hour.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">There was a Church at Cangas dedicate</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Whose rude and time-worn structure suited well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That vale among the mountains. Its low roof</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With stone plants and with moss was overgrown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Short fern, and richer weeds which from the eaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung their long tresses down. White lichens clothed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sides, save where the ivy spread, which bower’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The porch, and clustering round the pointed wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein two bells, each open to the wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung side by side, threaded with hairy shoots</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The double nich; and climbing to the cross,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wreathed it and half conceal’d its sacred form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With bushy tufts luxuriant. Here in the font, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Borne hither with rejoicing and with prayers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all the happy land who saw in him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lineage of their ancient Chiefs renew’d, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Prince had been immersed: and here within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An oaken galilee, now black with age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His old Iberian ancestors were laid.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Two stately oaks stood nigh, in the full growth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of many a century. They had flourish’d there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the Gothic sword was felt in Spain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the ancient sceptre of the Goths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was broken, there they flourish’d still. Their boughs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mingled on high, and stretching wide around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Form’d a deep shade, beneath which canopy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the ground Count Julian’s board was spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For to his daughter he had left his tent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pitch’d for her use hard by. He at the board</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sate with his trusted Captains, Gunderick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Felix and Miro, Theudered and Paul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Basil and Cottila, and Virimar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Men through all fortunes faithful to their Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to that old and tried fidelity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By personal love and honour held in ties</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strong as religious bonds. As there they sate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the distant vale a rising dust was seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And frequent flash of steel, ... the flying fight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of men who, by a fiery foe pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Put forth their coursers at full speed, to reach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The aid in which they trust. Up sprung the Chiefs,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hastily taking helm and shield, and spear,</div>

    <div class="verse indent20">Amid the chesnut groves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Sella’s side, Alphonso had in charge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To watch the foe; a prowling band came nigh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom with the ardour of impetuous youth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He charged and followed them in close pursuit:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quick succours join’d them; and the strife grew hot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere Pedro hastening to bring off his son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or Julian and his Captains, ... bent alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hour to abstain from combat, (for by this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full sure they deem’d Alcahman had secured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The easy means of certain victory,) ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could reach the spot. Both thus in their intent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">According, somewhat had they now allay’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fury of the fight, though still spears flew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And strokes of sword and mace were interchanged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When passing through the troop a Moor came up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On errand from the Chief, to Julian sent;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fatal errand fatally perform’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Julian, for the Chief, and for himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all that host of Musselmen he brought;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For while with well-dissembled words he lured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warrior’s ear, the dexterous ruffian mark’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The favouring moment and unguarded place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And plunged a javelin in his side. The Count,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell, but in falling called to Cottila,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Treachery! the Moor! the Moor!... He too on whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He call’d had seen the blow from whence it came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And seized the murderer. Miscreant! he exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who set thee on? The Musselman, who saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His secret purpose baffled, undismayed,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replies, What I have done is authorized;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To punish treachery and prevent worse ill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orpas and Abulcacem sent me here;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The service of the Caliph and the Faith</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Required the blow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">The Prophet and the Fiend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reward thee then! cried Cottila; meantime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take thou from me thy proper earthly meed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Villain!... and lifting as he spake the sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He smote him on the neck: the trenchant blade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through vein and artery pass’d and yielding bone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the shoulder, as the assassin dropt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His head half-severed fell. The curse of God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fall on the Caliph and the Faith and thee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stamping for anguish, Cottila pursued;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">African dogs, thus is it ye requite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our services?... But dearly shall ye pay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For this day’s work!... O Fellow-soldiers, here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stretching his hands toward the host, he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold your noble leader basely slain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He who for twenty years hath led us forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To war, and brought us home with victory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here he lies foully murdered, ... by the Moors, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those whom he trusted, whom he served so well!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our turn is next! but neither will we wait</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Idly, nor tamely fall!</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Amid the grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tumult, and rage, of those who gather’d round,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Julian could be heard, I have yet life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, for vengeance. Virimar, speed thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To yonder Mountaineers, and tell their Chiefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Julian’s veteran army joins this day</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo’s standard! The command devolves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Gunderick. Fellow-soldiers, who so well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Redress’d the wrongs of your old General,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye will not let his death go unrevenged!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tears then were seen on many an iron cheek,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And groans were heard from many a resolute heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And vows with imprecations mix’d went forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And curses check’d by sobs. Bear me apart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Julian, with a faint and painful voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let me see my daughter ere I die.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Scarce had he spoken when the pitying throng</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Divide before her. Eagerly she came;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A deep and fearful lustre in her eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A look of settled woe, ... pale, deadly pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet to no lamentations giving way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor tears nor groans; ... within her breaking heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She bore the grief, and kneeling solemnly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside him, raised her aweful hands to heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cried, Lord God! be with him in this hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two things have I to think of, O my child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vengeance and thee; said Julian. For the first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have provided: what remains of life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As best may comfort thee may so be best</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Employ’d; let me be borne within the church,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou, with that good man who follows thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Attend me there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Thus when Florinda heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her father speak, a gleam of heavenly joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shone through the anguish of her countenance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O gracious God, she cried, my prayers are heard;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now let me die!... They raised him from the earth;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, knitting as they lifted him his brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drew in through open lips and teeth firm-closed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His painful breath, and on the lance laid hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest its long shaft should shake the mortal wound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gently his men with slow and steady step</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their suffering burthen bore, and in the Church</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the altar laid him down, his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon Florinda’s knees.... Now, friends, said he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell. I ever hoped to meet my death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among ye, like a soldier, ... but not thus!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go join the Asturians; and in after years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When of your old commander ye shall talk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How well he loved his followers, what he was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In battle, and how basely he was slain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let not the tale its fit completion lack,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But say how bravely was his death revenged.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vengeance! in that good word doth Julian make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His testament; your faithful swords must give</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The will its full performance. Leave me now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have done with worldly things. Comrades, farewell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And love my memory!</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">They with copious tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of burning anger, grief exasperating</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their rage, and fury giving force to grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hasten’d to form their ranks against the Moors.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Julian meantime toward the altar turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His languid eyes: That Image, is it not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">St. Peter, he inquired, he who denied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His Lord and was forgiven?... Roderick rejoin’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is the Apostle; and may that same Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Julian, to thy soul’s salvation bless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The seasonable thought!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
    <div class="verse indent24">The dying Count</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then fix’d upon the Goth his earnest eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No time, said he, is this for bravery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As little for dissemblance. I would fain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Die in the faith wherein my fathers died,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whereto they pledged me in mine infancy....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A soldier’s habits, he pursued, have steel’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My spirit, and perhaps I do not fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This passage as I ought. But if to feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I have sinn’d, and from my soul renounce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Impostor’s faith, which never in that soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obtain’d a place, ... if at the Saviour’s feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laden with guilt, to cast myself and cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lord, I believe! help thou my unbelief!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If this in the sincerity of death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sufficeth, ... Father, let me from thy lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Receive the assurances with which the Church</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth bless the dying Christian.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">Roderick raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His eyes to Heaven, and crossing on his breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His open palms, Mysterious are thy ways</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And merciful, O gracious Lord! he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who to this end hast thus been pleased to lead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My wandering steps! O Father, this thy son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath sinn’d and gone astray: but hast not Thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said, When the sinner from his evil ways</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turneth, that he shall save his soul alive,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Angels at the sight rejoice in Heaven?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore do I, in thy most holy name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into thy family receive again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Him who was lost, and in that name absolve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Penitent.... So saying on the head</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Julian solemnly he laid his hands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then to the altar tremblingly he turn’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And took the bread, and breaking it, pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Julian! receive from me the Bread of Life!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In silence reverently the Count partook</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The reconciling rite, and to his lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick then held the consecrated cup.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Me too! exclaim’d Florinda, who till then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had listen’d speechlessly; Thou Man of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I also must partake! The Lord hath heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My prayers! one sacrament, ... one hour, ... one grave, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One resurrection!</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">That dread office done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian with amazement saw the Priest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kneel down before him. By the sacrament</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which we have here partaken, Roderick cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this most aweful moment; by that hope, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That holy faith which comforts thee in death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grant thy forgiveness, Julian, ere thou diest!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold the man who most hath injured thee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick, the wretched Goth, the guilty cause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all thy guilt, ... the unworthy instrument</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of thy redemption, ... kneels before thee here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prays to be forgiven!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Roderick! exclaim’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dying Count, ... Roderick!... and from the floor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With violent effort half he raised himself;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spear hung heavy in his side, and pain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And weakness overcame him, that he fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Back on his daughter’s lap. O Death, cried he, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Passing his hand across his cold damp brow, ...</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou tamest the strong limb, and conquerest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The stubborn heart! But yesterday I said</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One Heaven could not contain mine enemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And me: and now I lift my dying voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To say, Forgive me, Lord, as I forgive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Him who hath done the wrong!... He closed his eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moment; then with sudden impulse cried, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick, thy wife is dead, ... the Church hath power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To free thee from thy vows, ... the broken heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might yet be heal’d, the wrong redress’d, the throne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rebuilt by that same hand which pull’d it down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And these cursed Africans.... Oh for a month</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that waste life which millions misbestow!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His voice was passionate, and in his eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With glowing animation while he spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vehement spirit shone: its effort soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was past, and painfully with feeble breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In slow and difficult utterance he pursued, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vain hope, if all the evil was ordain’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this wide wreck the will and work of Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We but the poor occasion! Death will make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All clear, and joining us in better worlds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Complete our union there! Do for me now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One friendly office more: ... draw forth the spear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And free me from this pain!... Receive his soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saviour! exclaim’d the Goth, as he perform’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fatal service. Julian cried, O friend!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">True friend!... and gave to him his dying hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then said he to Florinda, I go first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou followest!... kiss me, child!... and now good night!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When from her father’s body she arose,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her cheek was flush’d, and in her eyes there beam’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A wilder brightness. On the Goth she gazed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While underneath the emotions of that hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exhausted life gave way. O God! she said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lifting her hands, thou hast restored me all, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All ... in one hour!... and round his neck she threw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her arms and cried, My Roderick! mine in Heaven!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Groaning, he claspt her close, and in that act</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And agony her happy spirit fled.</div>

RODERICK IN BATTLE.</h3>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Eight thousand men had to Asturias march’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath Count Julian’s banner; the remains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that brave army which in Africa</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So well against the Musselman made head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till sense of injuries insupportable,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And raging thirst of vengeance, overthrew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their leader’s noble spirit. To revenge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His quarrel, twice that number left their bones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slain in unnatural battle, on the field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Xeres, when the sceptre from the Goths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By righteous Heaven was reft. Others had fallen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Consumed in sieges, alway by the Moor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the front of war opposed. The policy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With whatsoever show of honour cloak’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was gross, and this surviving band had oft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At their carousals, of the flagrant wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held such discourse as stirs the mounting blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The common danger with one discontent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Affecting chiefs and men. Nor had the bonds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rooted discipline and faith attach’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus long restrain’d them, had they not known well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Julian in their just resentment shared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fix’d their hopes on him. Slight impulse now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sufficed to make these fiery martialists</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Break forth in open fury; and though first</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Pedro listen’d with suspicious ear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Julian’s dying errand, deeming it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some new decoy of treason, ... when he found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A second legate follow’d Virimar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then a third, and saw the turbulence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the camp, and how against the Moors in haste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They form’d their lines, he knew that Providence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This hour had for his country interposed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in such faith advanced to use the aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus wondrously ordain’d. The eager Chiefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hasten to greet him, Cottila and Paul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Basil and Miro, Theudered, Gunderick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Felix, and all who held authority;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The zealous services of their brave host</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They proffer’d, and besought him instantly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lead against the African their force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Combined, and in good hour assail a foe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Divided, nor for such attack prepared.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">While thus they communed, Roderick from the church</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came forth, and seeing Pedro, bent his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toward them. Sirs, said he, the Count is dead;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He died a Christian, reconciled to Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In faith; and when his daughter had received</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His dying breath, her spirit too took flight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One sacrament, one death, united them;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I beseech ye, ye who from the work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of blood which lies before us may return, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If, as I think, it should not be my fate ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in one grave with Christian ceremonies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye lay them side by side. In Heaven I ween</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They are met through mercy: ... ill befall the man</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who should in death divide them!... Then he turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His speech to Pedro in an under voice;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The King, said he, I know with noble mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will judge of the departed; Christian-like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He died, and with a manly penitence:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They who condemn him most should call to mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How grievous was the wrong which madden’d him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be that remember’d in his history,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let no shame be offer’d his remains.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">As Pedro would have answer’d, a loud cry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of menacing imprecation from the troops</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arose; for Orpas, by the Moorish Chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sent to allay the storm his villainy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had stirr’d, came hastening on a milk-white steed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And at safe distance having check’d the rein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beckon’d for parley. ’Twas Orelio</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On which he rode, Roderick’s own battle-horse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who from his master’s hand had wont to feed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with a glad docility obey</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His voice familiar. At the sight the Goth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Started, and indignation to his soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought back the thoughts and feelings of old times.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suffer me, Count, he cried, to answer him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hold these back the while! Thus having said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He waited no reply, but as he was,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bareheaded, in his weeds, and all unarm’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Advanced toward the renegade. Sir Priest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quoth Orpas as he came, I hold no talk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thee; my errand is with Gunderick</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Captains of the host, to whom I bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such liberal offers and clear proof....</div>
    <div class="verse indent38">The Goth,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breaking with scornful voice his speech, exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What, could no steed but Roderick’s serve thy turn?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I should have thought some sleek and sober mule</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long train’d in shackles to procession pace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More suited to my lord of Seville’s use</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than this good war-horse, ... he who never bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A villain, until Orpas cross’d his back!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wretch! cried the astonish’d renegade, and stoopt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Foaming with anger, from the saddle-bow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To reach his weapon. Ere the hasty hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trembling in passion could perform its will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick had seized the reins. How now, he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orelio! old companion, ... my good horse, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Off with this recreant burthen!... And with that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He raised his hand, and rear’d and back’d the steed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To that remember’d voice and arm of power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obedient. Down the helpless traitor fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Violently thrown, and Roderick over him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice led with just and unrelenting hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trampling hoofs. Go join Witiza now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where he lies howling, the avenger cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tell him Roderick sent thee!</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">At that sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s soldiers and the Asturian host</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Set up a shout, a joyful shout, which rung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wide through the welkin. Their exulting cry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With louder acclamation was renew’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When from the expiring miscreant’s neck they saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Roderick took the shield, and round his own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hung it, and vaulted in the seat. My horse!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My noble horse! he cried, with flattering hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Patting his high-arch’d neck! the renegade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thank him for’t, hath kept thee daintily!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orelio, thou art in thy beauty still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy pride and strength! Orelio, my good horse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once more thou bearest to the field thy Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He who so oft hath fed and cherish’d thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He for whose sake, wherever thou wert seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wert by all men honour’d. Once again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast thy proper master! Do thy part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As thou wert wont; and bear him gloriously,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My beautiful Orelio, ... to the last ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The happiest of his fields!... Then he drew forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scymitar, and waving it aloft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rode toward the troops; its unaccustom’d shape</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disliked him; Renegade in all things! cried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Goth, and cast it from him; to the Chiefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then said, If I have done ye service here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Help me, I pray you, to a Spanish sword!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trustiest blade that e’er in Bilbilis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was dipt, would not to-day be misbestowed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On this right hand!... Go some one, Gunderick cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bring Count Julian’s sword. Whoe’er thou art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The worth which thou hast shown avenging him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entitles thee to wear it. But thou goest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For battle unequipp’d; ... haste there and strip</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yon villain of his armour!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Late he spake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So fast the Moors came on. It matters not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replied the Goth; there’s many a mountaineer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who in no better armour cased this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than his wonted leathern gipion, will be found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the hottest battle, yet bring off untouch’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unguarded life he ventures.... Taking then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Count Julian’s sword, he fitted round his wrist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chain, and eyeing the elaborate steel</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With stern regard of joy, The African</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under unhappy stars was born, he cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who tastes thy edge!... Make ready for the charge!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They come ... they come!... On, brethren, to the field!...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The word is Vengeance!</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Vengeance was the word;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From man to man, and rank to rank it pass’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By every heart enforced, by every voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sent forth in loud defiance of the foe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The enemy in shriller sounds return’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their Akbar and the Prophet’s trusted name.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The horsemen lower’d their spears, the infantry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deliberately with slow and steady step</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Advanced; the bow-strings twang’d, and arrows hiss’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And javelins hurtled by. Anon the hosts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Met in the shock of battle, horse and man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conflicting; shield struck shield, and sword and mace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And curtle-axe on helm and buckler rung;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Armour was riven, and wounds were interchanged,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a spirit from its mortal hold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hurried to bliss or bale. Well did the Chiefs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Julian’s army in that hour support</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their old esteem; and well Count Pedro there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enhanced his former praise; and by his side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rejoicing like a bridegroom in the strife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alphonso through the host of infidels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bore on his bloody lance dismay and death.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But there was worst confusion and uproar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There widest slaughter and dismay, where, proud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his recover’d Lord, Orelio plunged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through thickest ranks, trampling beneath his feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The living and the dead. Where’er he turns</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moors divide and fly. What man is this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Appall’d they say, who to the front of war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bareheaded offers thus his naked life?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replete with power he is, and terrible,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like some destroying Angel! Sure his lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have drank of Kaf’s dark fountain, and he comes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strong in his immortality! Fly! fly!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They said, this is no human foe!... Nor less</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wonder fill’d the Spaniards when they saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How flight and terror went before his way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And slaughter in his path. Behold, cries one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With what command and knightly ease he sits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The intrepid steed, and deals from side to side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His dreadful blows! Not Roderick in his power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bestrode with such command and majesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That noble war-horse. His loose robe this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is death’s black banner, shaking from its folds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dismay and ruin. Of no mortal mould</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is he who in that garb of peace affronts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whole hosts, and sees them scatter where he turns!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Auspicious Heaven beholds us, and some Saint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Revisits earth!</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Aye, cries another, Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath ever with especial bounty blest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above all other lands its favour’d Spain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chusing her children forth from all mankind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For its peculiar people, as of yore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Abraham’s ungrateful race beneath the Law.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who knows not how on that most holy night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When peace on Earth by Angels was proclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The light which o’er the fields of Bethlehem shone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Irradiated whole Spain? not just display’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As to the Shepherds, and again withdrawn;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the long winter hours from eve till morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her forests and her mountains and her plains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her hills and valleys were embathed in light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A light which came not from the sun or moon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or stars, by secondary powers dispensed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But from the fountain-springs, the Light of Light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Effluent. And wherefore should we not believe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That this may be some Saint or Angel, charged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lead us to miraculous victory?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath not the Virgin Mother oftentimes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Descending, clothed in glory, sanctified</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With feet adorable our happy soil?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mark’d ye not, said another, how he cast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In wrath the unhallow’d scymitar away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And called for Christian weapon? Oh be sure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the aid of Heaven! On, comrades, on!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A miracle to-day is wrought for Spain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Victory and Vengeance! Hew the miscreants down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spare not! hew them down in sacrifice!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God is with us! his Saints are in the field!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Victory! miraculous Victory!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">Thus they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inflamed with wild belief the keen desire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of vengeance on their enemies abhorr’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Moorish chief, meantime, o’erlooked the fight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From an eminence, and cursed the renegade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose counsels sorting to such ill effect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had brought this danger on. Lo, from the East</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comes fresh alarm! a few poor fugitives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well-nigh with fear exanimate came up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Covadonga flying, and the rear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that destruction, scarce with breath to tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their dreadful tale. When Abulcacem heard,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stricken with horror, like a man bereft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sense, he stood. O Prophet, he exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hard and cruel fortune hast thou brought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day upon thy servant! Must I then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here with disgrace and ruin close a life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of glorious deeds? But how should man resist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fate’s irreversible decrees, or why</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Murmur at what must be? They who survive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May mourn the evil which this day begins:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My part will soon be done!... Grief then gave way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rage, and cursing Guisla, he pursued,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh that that treacherous woman were but here!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It were a consolation to give her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The evil death she merits!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">That reward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She hath had, a Moor replied. For when we reach’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The entrance of the vale, it was her choice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There in the farthest dwellings to be left,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest she should see her brother’s face; but thence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We found her flying at the overthrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And visiting the treason on her head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pierced her with wounds.... Poor vengeance for a host</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Destroyed! said Abulcacem in his soul.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howbeit, resolving to the last to do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His office, he roused up his spirit. Go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strike off Count Eudon’s head! he cried; the fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which brought him to our camp will bring him else</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In arms against us now; For Sisibert</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Ebba, he continued thus in thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their uncle’s fate for ever bars all plots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of treason on their part; no hope have they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of safety but with us. He call’d them then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With chosen troops to join him in the front</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of battle, that by bravely making head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Retreat might now be won. Then fiercer raged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The conflict, and more frequent cries of death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mingling with imprecations and with prayers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose through the din of war.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">By this the blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which Deva down her fatal channel pour’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Purpling Pionia’s course, had reach’d and stain’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wider stream of Sella. Soon far off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The frequent glance of spears and gleam of arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were seen, which sparkled to the westering orb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where down the vale, impatient to complete</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glorious work so well that day begun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo led his troops. On foot they came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chieftains and men alike; the Oaken Cross</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Triumphant borne on high, precedes their march,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And broad and bright the argent banner shone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick, who dealing death from side to side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had through the Moorish army now made way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beheld it flash, and judging well what aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approach’d, with sudden impulse that way rode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To tell of what had pass’d, ... lest in the strife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They should engage with Julian’s men, and mar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mighty consummation. One ran on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To meet him fleet of foot, and having given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His tale to this swift messenger, the Goth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Halted awhile to let Orelio breathe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Siverian, quoth Pelayo, if mine eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deceive me not, yon horse, whose reeking sides</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are red with slaughter, is the same on whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The apostate Orpas in his vauntery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wont to parade the streets of Cordoba.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But thou shouldst know him best; regard him well:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is’t not Orelio?</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">Either it is he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The old man replied, or one so like to him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom all thought matchless, that similitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would be the greater wonder. But behold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What man is he who in that disarray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Doth with such power and majesty bestride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble steed, as if he felt himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his own proper seat? Look how he leans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To cherish him; and how the gallant horse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Curves up his stately neck, and bends his head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if again to court that gentle touch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And answer to the voice which praises him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can it be Maccabee? rejoin’d the King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or are the secret wishes of my soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indeed fulfill’d, and hath the grave given up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its dead?... So saying, on the old man he turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eyes full of wide astonishment, which told</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The incipient thought that for incredible</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He spake no farther. But enough had pass’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For old Siverian started at the words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like one who sees a spectre, and exclaim’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blind that I was to know him not till now!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My Master, O my Master!</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">He meantime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With easy pace moved on to meet their march.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">King, to Pelayo he began, this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By means scarce less than miracle, thy throne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is stablish’d, and the wrongs of Spain revenged.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orpas the accursed, upon yonder field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lies ready for the ravens. By the Moors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Treacherously slain, Count Julian will be found</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before Saint Peter’s altar; unto him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grace was vouchsafed; and by that holy power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which at Visonia from the Primate’s hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his own proper act to me was given,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unworthy as I am, ... yet sure I think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not without mystery, as the event hath shown, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did I accept Count Julian’s penitence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And reconcile the dying man to Heaven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside him hath his daughter fallen asleep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deal honourably with his remains, and let</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One grave with Christian rites receive them both.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it not written that as the Tree falls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So it shall lie?</div>
    <div class="verse indent16">In this and all things else,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelayo answer’d, looking wistfully</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the Goth, thy pleasure shall be done.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Roderick saw that he was known, and turn’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His head away in silence. But the old man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laid hold upon his bridle, and look’d up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In his master’s face, weeping and silently.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thereat the Goth with fervent pressure took</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hand, and bending down toward him, said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My good Siverian, go not thou this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To war! I charge thee keep thyself from harm!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art past the age for battles, and with whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hereafter should thy mistress talk of me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou wert gone?... Thou seest I am unarm’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus disarray’d as thou beholdest me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clean through yon miscreant army have I cut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My way unhurt; but being once by Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Preserved, I would not perish with the guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of having wilfully provoked my death.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>

    <div class="verse indent30">And nobly done!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And he, rejoicing in his strength, rode on,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick and Vengeance!</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">Thus he made his way,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Diminish’d. Many a frustrate stroke was dealt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On either part, and many a foin and thrust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aim’d and rebated; many a deadly blow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Straight, or reverse, delivered and repell’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roderick at length with better speed hath reach’d</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Backing Orelio, drew him to the ground.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shrieking, as beneath the horse’s feet</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The story of Count Julian and his daughter has been treated
as a fable by some authors, because it is not mentioned by the
three writers who lived nearest the time. But those writers
state the mere fact of the conquest of Spain as briefly as possible,
without entering into particulars of any kind; and the
best Spanish historians and antiquaries are persuaded that there
is no cause for disbelieving the uniform and concurrent tradition
of both Moors and Christians.</p>

<p>For the purposes of poetry, it is immaterial whether the
story be true or false. I have represented the Count as a man
both sinned against and sinning, and equally to be commiserated
and condemned. The author of the Tragedy of Count Julian
has contemplated his character in a grander point of view, and
represented him as a man self-justified in bringing an army of
foreign auxiliaries to assist him in delivering his country from
a tyrant, and foreseeing, when it is too late to recede, the evils
which he is thus bringing upon her.</p>

<p>A Portugueze poet, Andre da Sylva Mascarenhas, is more
indulgent to the Count, and seems to consider it as a mark of
degeneracy in his own times, that the same crime would no
longer provoke the same vengeance. His catalogue of women
who have become famous by the evil of which they have been
the occasion, begins with Eve, and ends with Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p>Never has any country been so cursed by the spirit of persecution
as Spain. Under the Heathen Emperors it had its
full share of suffering, and the first fatal precedent of appealing
to the secular power to punish heresy with death, occurred in
Spain. Then came the Arian controversy. There was as
much bigotry, as much rancour, as little of the spirit of Christianity,
and as much intolerance, on one part as on the other:
but the successful party were better politicians, and more expert
in the management of miracles.</p>

<p>Near to the city of Osen, or Ossel, there was a famous
Catholic church, and a more famous baptistery, which was
in the form of a cross. On holy Thursday in every year, the
bishop, the clergy, and the people assembled there, saw that
the baptistery was empty, and enjoyed a marvellous fragrance
which differed from that of any, or all, flowers and spices, for
it was an odour which came as the vesper of the divine virtue
that was about to manifest itself: Then they fastened the doors
of the church and sealed them. On Easter Eve the doors
were opened, the baptistery was found full of water, and all the
children born within the preceding twelve months were baptized.
Theudisclo, an Arian king, set his seal also upon the
doors for two successive years, and set a guard there. Still
the miraculous baptistery was filled. The third year he suspected
pipes, and ordered a trench to be dug round the building;
but before the day of trial arrived, he was murdered, as
opportunely as Arius himself. The trench was dry, but the
workmen did not dig deep enough, and the miracle was continued.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
When the victory of the Catholic party was complete,
it was no longer necessary to keep it up. The same baptistery
was employed to convince the Spaniards of their error in keeping
Easter. In Brito’s time, a few ruins called Oscla, were
shown near the river Cambria; the broken baptistery was then
called the Bath, and some wild superstitions which the peasantry
related bore traces of the original legend. The trick was not
uncommon; it was practised in Sicily and in other places.
The story, however, is of some value, as showing that baptism
was administered<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> only once a year, (except in cases of danger,)
that immersion was the manner, and that infants were baptized.</p>

<p>Arianism seems to have lingered in Spain long after its
defeat. The names Pelayo (Pelagius), and Arias, certainly
appear to indicate a cherished heresy, and Brito<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> must have
felt this when he deduced the former name from Saint Pelayo
of the tenth century; for how came the Saint by it, and how
could Brito have forgotten the founder of the Spanish
monarchy?</p>

<p>In the latter half of the eleventh century, the Count of Barcelona,
Ramon Berenguer, <i>Cap de estopa</i>, as he was called, for
his bushy head, made war upon some Christians who are said
to have turned Arians, and took the castles into which they
retired.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> By the number of their castles, which he gave to
those chiefs who assisted him in conquering them, they appear
to have been numerous. It is not improbable that those people
were really what they are called; for Arian has never been, like
Manichæan, a term ignorantly and indiscriminately given to
heretics of all descriptions; and there is no heresy which
would be so well understood in Spain, and so likely to have
revived there.</p>

<p>The feelings of the triumphant party toward their opponents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
are well marked by the manner in which St. Isidore
speaks of the death of the Emperor Valens. <i>Thraciam ferro
incendiisque depopulantur, deletoque Romanorum exercitu ipsum
Valentem jaculo vulneratum, in quadam villa fugientem succenderunt,
ut merito ipse ab eis vivus temporali cremaretur incendio,
qui tam pulchras animas ignibus æternis<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> tradiderat.</i> If the
truth of this opinion should be doubted, there is a good Athanasian
miracle in the Chronicon<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of S. Isidore and Melitus,
to prove it. A certain Arian, by name Olympius, being in the
bath, blasphemed the Holy Trinity, and, behold! being struck
by an angel with three fiery darts, he was visibly consumed.</p>

<p>With regard to the Arians, the Catholics only did to the
others as the others would have done to them; but the persecution
of the Jews was equally unprovoked and inhuman.
They are said to have betrayed many towns to the Moors;
and it would be strange indeed if they had not, by every means
in their power, assisted in overthrowing a government under
which they were miserably oppressed. St. Isidore has a memorable
passage relating to their cruel persecution and compulsory
conversion under Sisebut; <i>Qui initio regni Judæos ad
Fidem Christianam permovens æmulationem quidem habuit, sed
non secundum scientiam: potestate enim compulit, ques provocare
fidei ratione oportuit. Sed sicut est scriptum sive per occasionem
sive per veritatem, Christus annuntiatur, in hoc gaudeo et gaudebo.</i>—S.
Isidor. Christ. Goth. Espana Sagrada, 6. 502.</p>

<p>The Moorish conquest procured for them an interval of
repose, till the Inquisition was established, and by its damnable
acts put all former horrors out of remembrance. When Toledo
was recovered from the Moors by Alonso VI., the Jews of that
city waited upon the conqueror, and assured him that they
were part of the ten tribes whom Nebuchadnezzar had transported
into Spain; not the descendants of the Jerusalem Jews
who had crucified Christ. Their ancestors, they said, were
entirely innocent of the crucifixion; for when Caiaphas the
high-priest had written to the Toledan synagogues to ask their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
advice respecting the person who called himself the Messiah,
and whether he should be slain, the Toledan Jews returned
for answer, that in their judgement the prophecies seemed to
be fulfilled in this person, and, therefore, he ought not by any
means to be put to death. This reply they produced in the
original Hebrew, and in Arabic, as it had been translated by
command of King Galifre. Alonso gave ear to the story, had
the letter rendered into Latin and Castilian, and deposited it
among the archives of Toledo. The latter version is thus
printed by Sandoval:—</p>

<p>Had Alonso been as zealous as some of his Gothic predecessors,
or his most Catholic successors, he might have found
a fair pretext in this letter for ordering all the Jews of Toledo
to the font, unless they would show cause why they should
adhere to the opinion of Caiaphas and the Jerusalem Jews,
rather than to that of their own ancestors.</p>

<p>General Vallancy believes that the Spanish Jews were
brought into the Peninsula by Nebuchadnezzar, and admits
these Toledans as authority. He quotes Count de Gebelin, and
refers to Strabo and Ezekiel. The proof from Ezekiel rests
upon the word Orb, Earb, Warb, or Gharb; which is made
into Algarve!</p>

<p>A Jew in Tirante el Blanco (p. 2. c. 74. f. 243.) explains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the difference between the different races of Jews. They are
three, he says. One the progeny of those who took counsel for
the death of Christ; and they were known by this, that they
were in continual motion, hands and feet, and never could rest;
neither could their spirit ever be still, and they had very little
shame. The second were the descendants of those who put
in execution and assisted at the various parts of the sufferings
and death of Christ, and they never could look any man in the
face, nor could they, without great difficulty, ever look up to
heaven. The third were the children of David, who did all
they could to prevent the death of Christ, and shut themselves
up in the temple that they might not witness it. These are
affable, good men, who love their neighbours; a quiet peaceable
race, who can look any where.</p>

<p>Thomas Tamaio de Vargas, the editor of the spurious Luitprand,
says, that not only many Hebrew words are mixed with
the old Spanish, but that, <i>prô dolor!</i> the black and stinking
Jewish blood had been mingled with the most pure blood of
the Spaniards. (p. 96.) They were very anxious, he says, to
intermarry, and spoil the pure blood. And he adds, that the
Spaniards call them <i>putos</i>, quia <i>putant</i>. “But,” says Sir
Thomas Browne, “that an unsavoury odour is gentilitious, or
national to the Jews, we cannot well concede. And if, (according
to good relations,) where they may freely speak it,
they forbear not to boast that there are at present many thousand
Jews in Spain, France, and England, and some dispensed
withal even to the degree of priesthood, it is a matter very
considerable, and could they be smelled out, would much advantage
not only the church of Christ, but also the coffers of
princes.—The ground that begat or propagated this assertion
might be the distasteful averseness of the Christian from the
Jew upon the villainy of that fact, which made them abominable,
and ‘stink in the nostrils of all men.’ Which real
practice and metaphorical expression did after proceed into a
literal construction, but was a fraudulent illation; for such an
evil savour their father Jacob acknowledged in himself, when
he said his sons had made him stink in the land, that is, to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
abominable unto the inhabitants thereof.—Another cause is
urged by Campegius, and much received by Christians; that
this ill savour is a curse derived upon them by Christ, and
stands as a badge or brand of a generation that crucified their
<i>Salvator</i>. But this is a conceit without all warrant, and an
easy way to take off dispute in what point of obscurity soever.”
<i>Vulgar Errors</i>, Book iv. ch. 10.</p>

<p>The Mahommedans also hold a like opinion of the unsavouriness
of the Jews, and account for it by this legend which is
given by Sale. “Some of the children of Israel abandoned their
dwellings because of a pestilence, or, as others say, to avoid
serving in a religious war; but as they fled, God struck them
all dead in a certain valley. About eight days or more
after, when their bodies were corrupted, the Prophet Ezekiel
happening to pass that way, at the sight wept; whereupon
God said to him, ‘Call to them, O Ezekiel, and I will restore
them to life.’ And accordingly, on the prophet’s call, they all
arose, and lived several years after; but they retained the
colour and stench of dead corpses as long as they lived, and the
clothes they wore were changed as black as pitch, which qualities
they transmitted to their posterity.”</p>

<p>One of our own travellers<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> tells us of a curious practical
application of this belief in Barbary. “The Moors of Tangier,”
he says, “when they want rain, and have prayed in vain
for it, set the Jews to work, saying, that though God would
not grant it to the prayers of the faithful, he would to the
Jews, in order to be rid of their stink.” Ludicrous as this is,
South has a passage concerning the Jews, which is little more
reasonable, in one of his sermons. “The truth is,” he says,
“they were all along a cross, odd, untoward sort of people,
and such as God seems to have chosen, and (as the Prophets
sometimes phrase it) to have espoused to himself, upon the
very same account that Socrates espoused Xantippe, only for
her extreme ill conditions, above all that he could possibly find
or pick out of that sex: and so the fittest argument both to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
exercise and declare his admirable patience to the world.”—Vol.
i. 421.</p>

<p>Of the condition of slaves under the Spanish Wisigoths, I
have given an account in the Introduction of the Chronicle of
the Cid. This also, like the persecution of the Jews, must
greatly have facilitated the Moorish conquest. Another
facilitating cause was, that notwithstanding their frequent civil
disturbances, they had in great measure ceased to be a warlike
people. The many laws in the Fuero Juzgo, for compelling
men to military service, prove this. These laws are full of
complaints that the people would avoid the service if they
could. Habits of settled life seem throughout Europe to have
effeminated the northern conquerors, till the Normans renovated
the race, and the institutions of chivalry and the crusades
produced a new era.</p>

<p>Gibel-al-Tarif, the mountain Tarif, is the received etymology
of Gibraltar: Ben Hazel, a Granadan Moor, says expressly,
that the mountain derived its name from this general.
Its former appellations may be seen in the <i>Historia de
Gibraltar</i>, by Don Ignacio Lopez de Ayala. The derivation
of the word Calpe is not known: Florian de Ocampo identifies
it with the English word <i>golloping</i>, in a passage which may
amuse the Spanish scholar. “<i>La segunda nombradia fue llamarle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
Calpe, cuya razon, segun dicen algunos, procedio de que
los Andaluces ancianos en su lengua vieja solian llamar Calepas
y Calpes a qualesquier cosas enhiestas y levantadas, agora fuesen
peñascos, o pizarras, o maderos, o piedras menores, como lo significamos
en los diez y ocho capitulos precedentes: y dicen que con
estar alli junto de Gibraltar sobre sus marinas el risco, que ya
dixe muy encumbrado y enhiesto, qual hoy dia parece, lo llamaban
Calpes aquellos Andaluces pasados: y por su respecto la mesma
poblacion vino tambien a tener despues aquel proprio nombre. No
faltan otras personas que siguiendo las Escrituras Griegas pongan
esta razon del nombre Calpes mucho diversamente, diciendo,
que quando los cosarios Argonautas desembarcaron en España,
cerca del estrecho, segun ya lo declaramos, el tiempo que hacian
sus exercicios arriba dichos, de saltos y luchas, y musicas acordadas,
bien asi como los pastores Españoles comarcanos recibian
contentamientos grande, mirado las tales desenvolturas y ligerezas,
no menos aquellos Griegos recien venidos notaban algunos juegos,
dudo que trabajosos y dificiles, que los mesmos pastores obraban
entre si para su recreacion y deporte; particularmente consideraran
un regocijo de caballos, donde ciertos dias aplazados venian
todos a se juntar como para cosa de gran pundonor.</i></p>

<p>“<i>El qual regocijo hacian desta manera. Tomaban yeguas en
pelo, quanto mas corredoras y ligeras podian haber, y puestos ellos
encima desnudos sin alguna ropa, ataban en las quixadas barbicachos
de rama, torcidos y majados a manera de freno, con que
salian del puesto dos a dos a la par corriendo lo mas que sus
yeguas podian, para llegar a cierta senal de pizarras enhiestas o
de maderos hincados y levantados en fin de la carrera. Venidos
al medio trecho de su corrida saltaban de las yeguas en tierra, no
las parando ni deteniendo: y asi trabados por el barbicacho,
corrian tambien ellos á pie, sin las dexar, puesto que mas furia
llevasen: porque si las dexaban ó se desprendian dellas, y no
sustentaban el freno continuamente, hasta ser pasada la carrera,
perdian la reputation y las apuestas, quedando tan amenguados y
vencidos, quanto quedaria triunfante quien primero llegase con su
yegua para tomar la presa que tenian en el fin de la carrera sobre
las pizarras o maderos hincados. Quando saltaban de sus yeguas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
dicen que les iban hablando porque no se detuviesen, voceandoles
y diciendoles a menudo palabras animosos y dulces: llamabanles
pies hermosas, generosas en el correr, casta real, hembras
preciosas, acrecentadoras de sus honras, y mas otras razones
muchas con que las tenian vezadas, a no se parar ni perder el
impetu comenzado: de manera que los tropeles en este punto, los
pundonores y regocijos de correr, y de no mostrar floxedad era
cosa mucho de notar, asi por la parte de los hombres, como por
parte de las yeguas. A los Griegos Argonautas les parecio juego
tan varonil que muchas veces lo probaron tambien ellos a
revuelta de los Espanoles, como quiera que jamas pudieron tener
aquella vigilancia ni ligereza, ni reciura que tenian estos otros
para durar con sus yeguas. Y dado que las tales yeguas
corriesen harto furiosas, y les ensenasen muchos dias antes
a seguir estas parejas, quanto mejor entendian a la verdad,
ni las de los unos, ni las de los otros corrian tanto despues
que saltaban dellas, como quando los traian encima: y asi las
palabras que los Griegos en aquella sazon puestos a pie hablaban
eran tambien al mesmo proposito conformes a las de los Andaluces
Españoles en su lengua, provincial, nombrandolas Calopes, Calopes,
Calopes a la contina, que fue palabra Griega, compuesta de dos
vocablos: uno Calos, que significa cosa hermosa, ligera y agraciada:
otro Pus, que quiere decir pie, como que las llamasen pies
agraciados, o pies desenvueltos y ligeros: y por abreviar mas el
vocablo, para que sus yeguas lo pudiesen mas presto sentir, acortabanlo
con una letra menos en el medio, y en lugar de nombrarlas
Calopes, les deciam Calpes, que significa lo mesmo Calopes: la
qual palabra me parece dura todavia hasta nuestro siglo presente,
donde pocas letras mudadas, por decir Calopes o Calpes, lo pronunciamos
Galopes, quando los caballos y yeguas, o qualesquier
otros animales, no corren a todo poder sino trote largo seguido.
Vino desto que las mesmas fiestas y manera del juego se nombraron
Calpes: dado que para conmigo bastara saber la victoria
deste juego consistir en ligereza de pies, y por eso solo deberse llamar
Calopes a Calpe, sin anadir lo que hablaban a las yeguas, pues
aquello primero comprehende bastantemente la razon deste vocablo.
Pero si todavia fue cierto que les decian aquellas palabras quando<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
corrian sus parejas, ninguna cosa daña dexarlas aquí puestas.</i>”—Coronica

<p>The author of the chivalrous Chronicle of King Don Rodrigo
gives a singular description of this car, upon the authority
of his pretended original Eleastras; for he, “seeing that
calamities went on increasing, and that the destruction of the
Goths was at hand, thought that if things were to end as they
had begun, it would be a marvel if there should be in Spain
any king or lord of the lineage of the Goths after the death of
King Don Rodrigo; and therefore it imported much that he
should leave behind him a remembrance of the customs of the
Gothic kings, and of the manner in which they were wont to
enter into battle and how they went to war. And he says,
that the king used to go in a car made after a strange fashion.
The wheels of this car were made of the bones of elephants,
and the axle-tree was of fine silver, and the perch was of fine
gold. It was drawn by two horses, who were of great size
and gentle; and upon the car there was pitched a tent, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
large that it covered the whole car, and it was of fine cloth of
gold, upon which were wrought all the great feats in arms
which had been achieved until that time; and the pillar of
the tent was of gold, and many stones of great value were set
in it, which sent forth such splendour, that by night there was
no need of any other light therein. And the car and the
horses bore the same adornments as the king, and these were
full of pearls the largest which could be found. And in the
middle of the car there was a seat placed against the pillar of
the tent; and this seat was of great price, insomuch that the
value of it cannot be summed up, so many and so great were
the stones which were set in it; and it was wrought so subtly,
and of such rare workmanship, that they who saw it marvelled
thereat. And upon this seat the king was seated, being lifted
up so high that all in the host, little or great, might behold
him. And in this manner it was appointed that the king
should go to war. And round about the car there were to go
a thousand knights, who had all been knighted by the hand of
the king, all armed; and in the day of battle they were to be on
foot round about the car; and all plighted homage to the king
not to depart from it in any manner whatsoever, and that they
would rather receive their death there, than go from their
place beside the car. And the king had his crown upon his
head. And in this guise all the kings of the Goths, who had
been lords of Spain, were to go to battle; and this custom
they had all observed till the King Don Rodrigo; but he,
because of the great grief which he had in his heart, would
never ascend the car, neither did he go in it into the battle.”—Part
i. c. 215.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Whose horns, amid the thickest of the fray</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Eminent, had mark’d his presence.</i>—<a href="#Page_3">I. p. 3.</a></div>
  </div>

<p>Morales describes this horned helmet from a coin. “<i>Tiene
de la una parte su rostro, harto diferente de los que en las otras
Monedas de estas Reyes parecen. Tiene manera de estar armado,
y salenle por cima de la celada unas puntas como cuernos pequeños<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
y derechos por ambos lados, que lo hacen estraño y espantable.</i>”
Florez has given this coin in his <i>Medallas de Espana</i>, from
the only one which was known to be in existence, and which
was then in the collection of the Infante D. Gabriel. It was
struck at Egitania, the present Idana, and, like all the coins
of the Visigoth kings, is of the rudest kind. The lines which
Morales describes are sufficiently apparent, and if they are not
intended for horns, it is impossible to guess what else they may
have been meant to represent.</p>

<p>“These Gothic coins,” says P. D. Jeronymo Contador de
Argote, “have a thousand barbarisms, as well in their letters
as in other circumstances. They mingle Greek characters
with Latin ones; and in what regards the relief or figure,
nothing can be more dissimilar than the representation to the
thing which it is intended to represent. I will relate what
happened to me with one, however much D. Egidio de Albornos
de Macedo may reprehend me for it in his <i>Parecer
Anathomico</i>. Valerio Pinto de Sa, an honourable citizen of
Braga, of whom, in various parts of these Memoirs, I have
made well-deserved mention, and of whose friendship I have
been proud ever since I have been in that city, gave me, some
six or seven years ago, a gold coin of King Leovigildo, who
was the first of the Gothic kings of Spain that coined money,
for till then both Goths and Sueves used the Roman. I examined
it leisurely, and what I clearly saw was a cross on the
one side upon some steps, and some ill-shaped letters around
it; and on the reverse something, I knew not what: It seemed
to me like a tree, or a stake which shot out some branches:
Round about were some letters, more distinct; I could not,
however, ascertain what they signified. It happened about
that time that I had the honour of a visit from the most illustrious
Sr. D. Francisco de Almeida, then a most worthy
Academician of the Royal Academy, and at present a most deserving
and eminent Principal of the Holy Patriarchal Church.
He saw this coin, and he also was puzzled by the side which
represented what I called a tree. He asked me to lend it
him, that he might examine it more at leisure. He took it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
away, and after some days returned it, saying, that he had
examined it with a microscope, and that what I had taken
for a stake was without question the portrait of King Leovigildo.
I confess that I was not yet entirely satisfied: however,
I showed it afterwards to divers persons, all of whom
said they knew not what the said figure could be; but when
I desired them to see if it could be this portrait, they all
agreed that it was. This undeceived me, and by looking at
the coin in every possible light, at last I came to see it also,
and acknowledge the truth with the rest. And afterwards
I found in the Dialogues of Antonio Agostinho, treating of
these Gothic coins, that there are some of such rude workmanship,
that where a face should be represented, some represent a
pitcher, and others an urn.”—<i>Memorias de Braga</i>, t. iii. p. lix.</p>

<p>Guadalete had been thus interpreted to Florez. (Espana
Sagrada, t. 9. p 53.) Earlier writers had asserted (but
without proof), that the Ancients called it Lethe, and the
Moors added to these names their word for river. Lope de

<p>The French jesuits relate of one of their converts in Canada
a Huron, by name Jean Armand Andeouarahen, that
once <i>estant en guerre eschauffé au combat, il s’enfonça si avant
dans les darts et les flêches des ennemis, qu’il fut abandonné des<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
siens dans le plus fort de la meslée. Ce fut alors qu’il se recommenda
plus particulièrement à Dieu: il sentit pour lors un
secours si présent, que du depuis, appuyé sur cette mesme confiance,
il est toûjours le premier et le plus avant dans les périls, et
jamais ne pâlit, pour quelque danger qu’il envisage. Je voyois,
disoit-il, comme une gresle de flêches venir fondre sur moy; je
n’avois point d’autre bouclier pour les arrester, que la croyance
seule que Dieu disposant de ma vie, il en feroit selon sa volonté.</i>
Chose étrange! les flêches s’écartoient à mes deux costez, ainsi,

vaisseau qui va contre marée.—<i>Relation de la N. France</i>, 1642,

<p>The site of this monastery, which was one of the most
flourishing seminaries of that age, is believed to have been two
leagues from Merida, upon the Guadiana, where the Ermida,
or Chapel of Cubillana, stands at present, or was standing a
few years ago. The legend, from which I have taken such
circumstances as might easily have happened, and as suited my
plan, was invented by a race of men who, in the talent of invention,
have left all poets and romancers far behind them.
Florez refers to Brito for it, and excuses himself from relating
it, because it is not necessary to his<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> subject;—in reality
he neither believed the story, nor chose to express his objections
to it. His disbelief was probably founded upon the suspicious
character of Brito, who was not at that time so decidedly
condemned by his countrymen as he is at present. I
give the legend from this veracious Cistercian. Most of his
other fabrications have been exploded, but this has given rise
to a popular and fashionable idolatry, which still maintains its
ground.</p>

<p>“The monk did not venture to leave him alone in that disconsolate
state, and taking him apart, besought him by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
passion of Jesus Christ to consent that they twain should go
together, and save a venerable image of the Virgin Mary our
Lady, which in that convent flourished with great miracles,
and had been brought from the city of Nazareth by a Greek
monk, called Cyriac, at such time as a heresy in the parts of
the East arose against the use and veneration of images; and
with it a relic of the Apostle St. Bartholomew, and another of
St. Bras, which were kept in an ivory coffer, for it would be
a great sacrilege to leave them exposed to the ill-treatment of
barbarians, who, according to public fame, left neither temple
nor sacred place which they did not profane, casting the images
into the fire, and dragging them at their horses’s tails for a
greater opprobrium to the baptized people. The King, seeing
himself thus conjured by the passion of our Redeemer Jesus
Christ, in whom alone he had consolation and hope of remedy,
and considering the piety of the thing in which he was chosen
for companion, let himself be overcome by his entreaties; and
taking in his arms the little image of our Lady, and Romano
the coffer with the relics, and some provision for the journey,
they struck into the middle of Portugal, having their faces
alway towards the west, and seeking the coast of the ocean sea,
because in those times it was a land more solitary, and less
frequented by people, where they thought the Moors would
not reach so soon, because, as there were no countries to conquer
in those parts, there was no occasion which should lead them
thither. Twenty-and-six days the two companions travelled
without touching at any inhabited place, and after enduring
many difficulties in crossing mountains and fording rivers,
they had sight of the ocean sea on the 22d of November, being
the day of the Virgin Martyr St. Cecilia; and as if in that
place they should have an end of their labours, they took some
comfort, and gave thanks to God, for that he had saved them
from the hand of their enemies. The place which they
reached is in the <i>Coutos</i> of Alcobaça, near to where we now
see the town of Pederneira, on the eastern side of which there
rises, in the midst of certain sands, a hill of rock and firm land,
somewhat prolonged from north to south, so lofty and well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
proportioned that it seemeth miraculously placed in that site
being surrounded on all sides with plains covered with sand,
without height or rock to which it appears connected. And
forasmuch as the manner thereof draws to it the eyes of whosoever
beholds this work of nature, the king and the monk
desired to ascend the height of it, to see whether it would
afford a place for them in which to pass their lives. They
found there a little hermitage with a holy crucifix, and no
other signs of man, save only a plain tomb, without writing or
epitaph to declare whose it might be. The situation of the
place, which, ascending to a notable height, gives a prospect
by sea and by land as far as the eyes can reach, and the sudden
sight of the crucifix, caused in the mind of the king such excitement
and so great consolation, that embracing the foot of
the cross, he lay there melting away in rivers of tears, not now
of grief for the kingdoms and dominions which he had lost,
but of consolation in seeing that in exchange the crucified
Jesus himself had in this solitary mountain offered himself to
him, in whose company he resolved to pass the remainder of
his life; and this he declared to the monk, who, to content
him, and also because he saw that the place was convenient
for contemplation, approved the king’s resolve, and abode there
with him some days; during which perceiving some inconvenience
in living upon the summit of the mountain, from
whence it was necessary to descend with much labour, whenever
they would drink, or seek for herbs and fruits for their
food; and moreover understanding that it was the king’s desire
to remain there alone, that he might vent himself in tears
and exclamations, which he made oftentimes before the image
of Christ, he went with his consent to a place little more than
a mile from the mountain, which being on the one side smooth
and of easy approach, hangs on the other over the sea with so
huge a precipice that it is two hundred fathoms in perpendicular
height, from the top of the rock to the water. There, between
two great rocks, each of which projects over the sea,
hanging suspended from the height in such a form, that they
seem to threaten destruction to him who sees them from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
beach, Romano found a little cave, made naturally in the cliff,
which he enlarged with some walls of loose stone, built up
with his own hands, and having thus made a sort of hermitage,
he placed therein the image of the Virgin Mary of Nazareth,
which he had brought from the Caulinean convent, and which
being small, and of a dark colour, with the infant Jesus in its
arms, hath in the countenance a certain perfection, with a
modesty so remarkable, that at first sight it presents something
miraculous; and having been known and venerated so great a
number of years, during many of which it was in a place which
did not protect it from the injuries of weather, it hath never
been painted, neither hath it been found necessary to renew it.
The situation of this hermitage was, and is now, within sight
of the mountain where the king dwelt; and though the memorials
from whence I am deriving the circumstances of these
events do not specify it, it is to be believed that they often saw
each other, and held such divine communion as their mode of
life and the holiness of the place required; especially considering
the great temptations of the Devil which the king suffered
at the beginning of his penitence, for which the counsels and
instructions of the monk would be necessary, and the aid of
his prayers, and the presence of the relics of St. Bartholomew,
which miraculously saved him many times from various illusions
of the enemy. And in these our days there are seen upon the
top of the mountain, in the living rock, certain human footsteps,
and others of a different form, which the common people,
without knowing the person, affirm to be the footsteps of St.
Bartholomew and the Devil, who was there defeated and his
illusions confounded by the saint, coming in aid of a devout
man who called upon him in the force of his tribulation. This
must have been the king, (though the common people know it
not,) whom the saint thus visibly aided, and he chose that for
a memorial of this aid, and of the power which God has given
him over the evil spirits, these marks should remain impressed
upon the living rock. And the ancient name of the mountain
being Seano, it was changed into that of the Apostle, and is
called at present St. Bartholomew’s; and the hermitage which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
remains upon the top of it is under the invocation of the same
saint and of St. Bras, which must have arisen from the relics
of these two saints that Romano brought with him and left
with the king for his consolation, when he withdrew with the
image of Our Lady to the place of which we have spoken,
where he lived little more than a year; and then knowing the
time of his death, he communicated it to the king, beseeching
him that, in requital for the love with which he had accompanied
him, he would remember to pray to God for his soul,
and would give his body to the earth, from which it had
sprung; and that having to depart from that land, he would
leave there the image and the relics, in such manner as he
should dispose them before he died. With that Romano departed
to enjoy the reward deserved by his labours, leaving the
king with fresh occasion of grief for want of so good a companion.
Of what more passed in this place, and of the temptations
and tribulations which he endured till the end of his
life, there is no authentic historian, nor memorial which should
certify them, more than some relations mingled with fabulous
tales in the ancient Chronicle of King Don Rodrigo, where,
among the truths which are taken from the Moor Rasis, there
are many things notoriously impossible; such as the journey
which the king took, being guided by a white cloud till he
came near Viseo; and the penance in which he ended his life
there, inclosing himself alive in a certain tomb with a serpent
which he had bred for that purpose. But as these are things
difficult to believe, we will pass them over in silence, leaving
to the judgement of the curious the credit which an ancient
picture deserves, still existing near Viseo, in the church of
St. Michael, over the tomb of the said King Don Roderick, in
which is seen a serpent painted with two heads; and in the
tomb itself, which is of wrought stone, a round hole, through
which they say that the snake entered. That which is certain
of all this is, as our historians relate, that the king came to this
place, and in the hermitage of St. Michael, which we now see
near Visco, ended his days in great penance, no man knowing
the manner thereof; neither was there any other memorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
clearer than that in process of time a writing was found upon
a certain tomb in this church with these words; <span class="smcap">Hic reqviescit
Rudericus ultimus Rex Gothorum</span>, Here rests
Roderick, the last King of the Goths. I remember to have
seen these very words written in black upon an arch of the
wall, which is over the tomb of the king, although the Archbishop
Don Rodrigo, and they who follow him, give a longer
inscription, not observing that all which he has added are his
own curses and imprecations upon Count Don Julian, (as
Ambrosio de Morales has properly remarked, following the
Bishop of Salamanca and others,) and not parts of the same
inscription, as they make them. The church in which is the
tomb of the king is at present very small, and of great antiquity,
especially the first chapel, joined to which on either side
is a cell of the same length, but narrow, and dark also, having
no more light than what enters through a little window opening
to the east. In one of these cells (that which is on the
south side) it is said that a certain hermit dwelt, by whose
advice the king governed himself in the course of his penance;
and at this time his grave is shown close to the walls of the
chapel, on the Epistle side. In the other cell (which is on
the north) the king passed his life, paying now, in the straitness
of that place, for the largeness of his palaces, and the liberties
of his former life, whereby he had offended his Creator. And
in the wall of the chapel which answers to the Gospel side,
there remains a sort of arch, in which the tomb is seen, wherein
are his bones; and it is devoutly visited by the natives, who
believe that through his means the Lord does miracles there
upon persons afflicted with agues and other like maladies.
Under the said arch, in the part answering to it in the inside
of the cell, I saw painted on the wall the hermit and the king,
with the serpent with two heads, and I read the letters which
are given above, all defaced by time, and bearing marks of
great antiquity, yet so that they could distinctly be seen. The
tomb is flat and made of a single stone, in which a man’s body
can scarcely find room. When I saw it it was open, the stone
which had served to cover it not being there, neither the bones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
of the king, which they told me had been carried into Castille
some years before, but in what manner they knew not, nor by
whose order; neither could I discover, by all the enquiries
which I made among the old people of that city, who had
reason to be acquainted with a thing of so much importance, if
it were as certain as some of them affirmed it to be.”—<span class="smcap">Brito</span>,
<i>Monarchia Lusitania</i>, P. ii. l. 7. c. 3.</p>

<p>“The great venerableness of the Image of our Lady of
Nazareth which the king left hidden in the very place where
Romano in his lifetime had placed it, and the continual miracle
which she showed formerly, and still shows,” induced F. Bernardo
de Brito to continue the history of this Image, which,
no doubt, he did the more willingly because he bears a part in
it himself. In the days of Affonso Henriquez, the first king
of Portugal, this part of the country was governed by D. Fuas
Roupinho, a knight famous in the Portugueze chronicles, who
resided in the castle at Porto de Mos. This Dom Fuas
“when he saw the land secure from enemies, used often to go
out hunting among the sands and thickets between the town
and the sea, where, in those days, there used to be great store
of game, and even now, though the land is so populous, there is
still some; and as he followed this exercise, the proper pastime
of noble and spirited men, and came sometimes to the seashore,
he came upon that remarkable rock, which being level
on the side of the north, and on a line with the flat country,
ends towards the south in a precipice over the waves of the
sea, of a prodigious height, causing the greater admiration to
him who, going over the plain country without finding any
irregularity, finds himself, when least expecting it, suddenly
on the summit of such a height. And as he was curiously
regarding this natural wonder, he perceived between the two
biggest cliffs which stand out from the ground and project
over the sea, a sort of house built of loose stones, which, from
its form and antiquity, made him go himself to examine it;
and descending by the chasm between the two rocks, he entered
into a low cavern, where, upon a little altar, he saw the
venerable Image of the Virgin Mary of Nazareth, being of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
such perfection and modesty as are found in very few images
of that size. The catholic knight venerated it with all submission,
and would have removed it to his castle of Porto de
Mos, to have it held in more veneration, but that he feared to
offend it if he should move it from a habitation where it had
abode for so many years. This consideration made him leave
it for the present in the same place and manner in which he
found it; and although he visited it afterwards when in course
of the chase he came to those parts, nevertheless he never took
in hand to improve the poor hermitage in which it was, nor
would he have done it, if the Virgin had not saved him from
a notorious danger of death, which, peradventure, God permitted,
as a punishment for his negligence, and in this manner
to make the virtue of the Holy Image manifest to the world.
It was thus, that going to his ordinary exercise of the chase,
in the month of September, in the year of Christ 1182, and
on the 14th of the month, being the day on which the church
celebrates the festival of the Exaltation of the Cross upon the
which Christ redeemed the human race, as the day rose thick
with clouds, which ordinarily arise from the sea, and the
country round about could not be seen by reason of the clouds,
save for a little space, it befell that the dogs put up a stag, (if
indeed it were one,) and Dom Fuas pressing his horse in pursuit,
without fear of any danger, because he thought it was
all plain ground, and the mist hindered him from seeing where
he was, found himself upon the very edge of the rock on the
precipice, two hundred fathoms above the sea, at a moment
when it was no longer in his power to turn the reins, nor
could he do any thing more than invoke the succours of the
Virgin Mary, whose image was in that place; and she succoured
him in such a manner, that less than two palms from
the edge of the rock, on a long and narrow point thereof, the
horse stopt as if it had been made of stone, the marks of his
hoofs remaining in proof of the miracle imprinted in the living
rock, such as at this day they are seen by all strangers and
persons on pilgrimage, who go to visit the Image of Our
Lady; and it is a notable thing, and deserving of serious consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
to see that in the midst of this rock, upon which
the miracle happened, and on the side towards the east, and in
a part where, because it is suspended in the air, it is not possible
that any human being could reach, Nature herself has
impressed a cross as if nailed to the hardness of the rock, as
though she had sanctified that cliff therewith, and marked it
with that holy sign, to be the theatre in which the miraculous
circumstance was to be celebrated; which, by reason that
it took place on the day of the Exaltation of the Cross, seemed
as if it showed the honour and glory which should from thence
redound to the Lord who redeemed us thereon. Dom Fuas
seeing himself delivered from so great danger, and knowing
from whence the grace had come to him, went to the little
hermitage, where, with that great devotion which the presence
of the miracle occasioned, he gave infinite thanks to Our Lady,
accusing himself before her of having neglected to repair the
house, and promising all the amends which his possibility permitted.
His huntsmen afterwards arrived, following the track
of the horse, and knowing the marvel which had occurred,
they prostrated themselves before the Image of Our Lady,
adding with their astonishment to the devotion of Dom Fuas,
who, hearing that the stag had not been seen, and that the
dogs had found no track of him in any part, though one had
been represented before him to draw him on, understood that
it was an illusion of the Devil, seeking by that means to make
him perish miserably. All these considerations enhanced the
greatness of the miracle, and the obligations of Dom Fuas,
who, tarrying there some days, made workmen come from
Leyria and Porto de Mos, to make another hermitage, in
which the Lady should be more venerated; and as they were
demolishing the first, they found placed between the stones of
the altar a little box of ivory, and within it relicks of St. Bras,
St. Bartholomew, and other saints, with a parchment, wherein
a relation was given of how, and at what time those relicks
and the image were brought there, according as has been
aforesaid. A vaulted chapel was soon made, after a good
form for times so ancient, over the very place where the Lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
had been; and to the end that it might be seen from all
sides, they left it open with four arches, which in process of
time were closed, to prevent the damage which the rains
and storms did within the chapel, and in this manner it remains
in our days. The Lady remained in her place, being
soon known and visited by the faithful, who flocked there
upon the fame of her appearance: the valiant and holy king
D. Affonso Henriquez, being one of the first whom Dom
Fuas advised of what had happened, and he, accompanied with
the great persons of his court, and with his son, D. Sancho,
came to visit the Image of the Lady, and see with his own
eyes the marks of so rare a miracle as that which had taken
place; and with his consent, D. Fuas made a donation to the
Lady of a certain quantity of land round about, which was at
that time a wild thicket, and for the greater part is so still,
being well nigh all wild sands incapable of giving fruit, and
would produce nothing more than heath and some wild pine-trees.
And because it establishes the truth of all that I have
said, and relates in its own manner the history of the Image of
the Lady, I will place it here in the form in which I saw
it in the Record Room at Alcobaça, preserving throughout
the Latin and the barbarism of its composition; which is as
follows:—</p>

<p>This deed, which establishes all the principal facts that I
have related, did not take effect, because the lands of which it
disposed were already part of the <i>Coutos</i> of Alcobaça, which
King Don Affonso had given some years before to our father
St. Bernard; and Dom Fuas compensated for them with certain
properties near Pombal, as is proved by another writing
annexed to the former, but which I forbear to insert, as appertaining
little to the thread of my history: and resuming the
course thereof, you must know, that the image of the Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
Mary of Nazareth remained in the chapel which Dom Fuas
made for it, till the year of Christ, 1377, in the which, King
Dom Fernando of Portugal founded for it the house in which
it now is, having been enlarged and beautified by Queen Dona
Lianor, wife of King Dom Joam II., and surrounded with
porticoes by King Dom Manoel. And now in our times a
chapel (<i>Capela mor</i>) of good fabric has been built, with voluntary
contributions, and the rents of the brotherhood; and in
the old hermitage founded by Dom Fuas I., with the help
of some devout persons, had another chapel opened under
ground, in order to discover the very rock and cavern in which
the Holy Image had been hidden so great a number of years;
there is a descent to it by eight or ten steps, and a notable
consolation it is to those who consider the great antiquity of
that sanctuary. And for that the memory of things so remarkable
ought not to be lost, I composed an inscription briefly
recounting the whole: and Dr. Ruy Lourenço, who was then
Provedor of the Comarca of Leyria, and visitor of the said
church for the king, ordered it to be engraven in marble. It
is as follows:—</p>

<p>From these things, taken as faithfully as I possibly could
from the deed of gift and from history, we see clearly the great
antiquity of this sanctuary, since it is 893 years since the
Image of the Lady was brought to the place where it now is;
and although we do not know the exact year in which it was
brought from Nazareth, it is certain at least that it was before
King Recaredo, who began to reign in the year of Christ 586;
so that it is 1021 years, a little more or less, since it came to
Spain; and as it came then, as one well known, and celebrated
for miracles in the parts of the East, it may well be understood
that this is one of the most famous and ancient Images, and
nearest to the times of the apostles, that the world at present
possesses.—<i>Brito Monarchia Lusitana</i>, p. 2. l. 7. c. 4.</p>

<p>This legend cannot have been invented before Emanuel’s
reign, for Duarte Galavam says nothing of it in his Chronicle
of Affonso Henriquez, though he relates the exploits and death
of D. Fuas Roupinho. I believe there is no earlier authority
for it than Bernardo de Brito himself. It is one of many
articles of the same kind from the great manufactory of Alcobaça,
and is at this day as firmly believed by the people of
Portugal as any article of the Christian faith. How indeed
should they fail to believe it? I have a print, it is one of the
most popular devotional prints in Portugal, which represents
the miracle. The diabolical stag is flying down the precipice,
and looking back with a wicked turn of the head, in hopes of
seeing Dom Fuas follow him; the horse is rearing up with his
hind feet upon the brink of the precipice; the knight has
dropt his hunting-spear, his cocked hat is falling behind him,
and an exclamation to the Virgin is coming out of his mouth.
The Virgin with a crown upon her head, and the Babe with a
crown upon his, at her breast, appear in the sky amidst clouds
of glory. <i>N. S. de Nazaré</i>, is written above this precious
print, and this more precious information below it,—<i>O. Emo.
Snr. Cardeal Patriarcha concede 50 dias de Indulgᵃ. a qm. rezar
huma have Ma. diante desta Image.</i> His Eminency the Cardinal
Patriarch grants fifty days indulgence to whosoever shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
say an Ave-Maria before this Image. The print is included,
and plenty of Ave-Marias are said before it in full faith, for this
<i>Nossa Senhora de Nazaré</i> is in high vogue. Before the French
invasion, this famous Image used annually to be escorted by the
Court to Cape Espichel. In 1796 I happened to be upon the
Tagus at the time of her embarkation at Belem. She was
carried in a sort of sedan-chair, of which the fashion resembled
that of the Lord Mayor’s coach; a processional gun-boat preceded
the Image and the Court, and I was literally caught in
a shower of rockets, if any of which had fallen upon the
heretical heads of me and my companion, it would not improbably
have been considered as a new miracle, wrought by the
wonder-working Senhora.</p>

<p>In July 1808, the French, under General Thomières, robbed
this church of Our Lady of Nazareth; their booty, in jewels

Accursio das Neves, the Portugueze historian of those disastrous
times, expresses his surprise that no means should have
been taken by those who had the care of these treasures, for
securing them in time. Care, however, seems to have been
taken of the Great Diana of the Temple, for though it is
stated that they destroyed or injured several images, no mention
is made of any insult or damage having been offered to this.
They sacked the town and set fire to it, but it escaped with
the loss of only thirteen or fourteen houses; the suburb or
village, on the beach, was less fortunate: there only four houses
of more than 300 remained unconsumed, and all the boats and
fishing-nets were destroyed.—<i>Historia da Invasam, &amp;c.</i>, t. 4.

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>In Syrian fields of glory, or the sands</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Of holiest Egypt.</i>—<a href="#Page_17">II. p. 17.</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Egypt has been, from the earliest ages, the theatre of the
most abject and absurd superstitions, and very little benefit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
was produced by a conversion which exchanged crocodiles and
monkies for monks and mountebanks. The first monastery is
said to have been established in that country by St. Anthony
the Great, towards the close of the third century. He who
rests in solitude, said the saint, is saved from three conflicts,—from
the war of hearing, and of speech, and of sight; and he
has only to maintain the struggle against his own heart. (<i>Acta
Sanctorum</i>, t. ii. p. 143.) Indolence was not the only virtue
which he and his disciples introduced into the catalogue of
Christian perfections. S. Eufraxia entered a convent consisting
of an hundred and thirty nuns, not one of whom had ever
washed her feet; the very mention of the bath was an abomination
to them.—(<i>Acta Sanctorum, March 13.</i>) St. Macarius
had renounced most of the decencies of life; but he returned
one day to his convent, humbled and mortified, exclaiming,—I
am not yet a monk, but I have seen monks! for he had met
two of these wretches stark naked.—<i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, i. p. 107.</p>

<p>The principles which these madmen established were, that
every indulgence is sinful; that whatever is gratifying to the
body, must be injurious to the soul; that in proportion as man
inflicts torments upon himself, he pleases his Creator; that the
ties of natural affection wean the heart from God; and that
every social duty must be abandoned by him who would be
perfect. The doctrine of two principles has never produced such
practical evils in any other system as in the Romish. Manes,
indeed, attributes all evil to the equal power of the Evil Principle,
(that power being only for a time,) but some of the corrupted
forms of Christianity actually exclude a good one!</p>

<p>There is a curious passage in the Bibliotheca Orientalis of
Assemanus, in which the deserts are supposed to have been
originally intended for the use of these saints, compensating for
their sterility by the abundant crop of virtues which they were
to produce! <i>In illâ vero soli vastitate, quæ procul a Nili ripis
quaquaversus latissime protenditur, non urbes, non domicilia, non
agri, non arbores, sed desertum, arena, feræ; non tamen hanc
terræ partem (ut Eucherii verbis utar) inutilem et inhonoratam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
dimisit Deus, quum in primordiis rerum omnia in sapientiâ faceret,
et singula quæque futuris usibus apta distingueret; sed
cuncta non magis præsentis magnificentiâ, quam futuri præscientiâ
creans, venturis, ut arbitror, Sanctis Eremum paravit.
Credo, his illam locupletem fructibus voluit, et pro indulgentioris
naturæ vice, hanc Sanctorum dare fœcundiam, ut sic pinguescerent
fines deserti: Et quum irrigaret de superioribus suis montes,
abundaret quoque multiplicata fruge convalles locorumque damna
supplicet, quum habitationem sterilem habitatore ditaret.</i></p>

<p>“If the ways of religion,” says South, “are ways of pleasantness,
such as are not ways of pleasantness, are not truly and
properly ways of religion. Upon which ground it is easy to see
what judgement is to be passed upon all those affected, uncommanded,
absurd austerities, so much prized and exercised by
some of the Romish profession. Pilgrimages, going barefoot,
hair-shirts and whips, with other such gospel-artillery, are their
only helps to devotion; things never enjoined, either by the
prophets under the Jewish, or by the apostles under the
Christian economy, who yet surely understood the proper and
the most efficacious instruments of piety, as well as any confessor
or friar of all the order of St. Francis, or any casuist
whatsoever.</p>

<p>“It seems that with them a man sometimes cannot be a
penitent unless he also turns vagabond, and foots it to Jerusalem,
or wanders over this or that part of the world to visit
the shrines of such or such a pretended saint, though perhaps
in his life ten times more ridiculous than themselves. Thus,
that which was Cain’s error, is become their religion. He
that thinks to expiate a sin by going barefoot, only makes one
folly the atonement for another. Paul, indeed, was scourged
and beaten by the Jews, but we never read that he beat or
scourged himself; and if they think that his <i>keeping under of
his body</i> imports so much, they must first prove that the body
cannot be kept under by a virtuous mind, and that the mind
cannot be made virtuous but by a scourge, and consequently
that thongs and whip-cord are means of grace, and things necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
to salvation. The truth is, if men’s religion lies no
deeper than their skin, it is possible that they may scourge
themselves into very great improvements.</p>

<p>“But they will find that bodily exercise touches not the
soul, and that neither pride, nor lust, nor covetousness, was
ever mortified by corporal discipline; ’tis not the back, but
the heart that must bleed for sin; and, consequently, that in
their whole course they are like men out of their way; let
them lash on never so fast, they are not at all the nearer to
their journey’s end; and howsoever they deceive themselves
and others, they may as well expect to bring a cart as a soul to
Heaven by such means.”—<i>Sermons</i>, vol. i. p. 34.</p>

<p>The history of Europe during the dark ages abounds with
examples of <i>exoculation</i>, as it was called by those writers who
endeavoured, towards the middle of the 17th century, to introduce
the style-ornate into our prose after it had been banished
from poetry. In the East, the practice is still continued.
When Alboquerque took possession of Ormuz, he sent to Portugal
fifteen of its former kings, whom he found there, each of
whom, in his turn, had been deposed and blinded!</p>

<p>In the semi-barbarous stage of society, any kind of personal
blemish seems to have been considered as disqualifying a prince
from the succession, like the law of the Nazarenes. Yorwerth,
the son of Owen Gwynedh, was set aside in Wales because of
his broken nose; Count Oliba, in Barcelona, because he could
never speak till he had stamped with his foot three times like
a goat. <i>Aquest Oliba frare del Conte en Grifa no era a dret de
sos membras. Car lo dit Oliba james no podia parlar, si primer
no donas colps ab lo peu en terra quart o sinc vegades, axi comsi
fos cabra; e per aquesta raho li fou imposat lo nom, dient li Olibra
Cabreta, e per aquest accident lo dit Oliba perde la successio
del frare en lo Comtat de Barcelona, e fou donat lo dit Comtat o
en Borrell, Comte de Urgell, qui era son cosin germa.</i>—Père
Tomich, c. xxviii. ff. 20.</p>

<p>In the treaty between our Henry V. and Charles VI. of
France, by which Henry was appointed King of France after
Charles’s decease, it was decreed that the French should “swear
to become liege men and vassals to our said son King Henry,
and obey him as the true King of France, and without any
opposition or dispute shall receive him as such, and never pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
obedience to any other as king or regent of France, but to our
said son King Henry, unless our said son should lose life or

<p>A remarkable instance of the inconvenient manner in which
the <i>b</i> and the <i>v</i> are indiscriminately used by the Spaniards,
occurs here in the original edition. The <i>w</i> not being used in
that language, it would naturally be represented by <i>vv</i>; and
here, the printer, using most unluckily his typographical
licence, has made the word <i>Vbitisa</i>.</p>

<p>“The Spaniards,” says that late worthy Jo. Sandford, some
time fellow of Magdalane college, in Oxford, (in his Spanish
Grammar, 1632) “do with a kind of wantonness so confound
the sound of <i>b</i> with <i>v</i>, that it is hard to determine when and in
what words it should retain its own power of a labial letter,
which gave just cause of laughter at that Spaniard who, being
in conversation with a French lady, and minding to commend
her children for fair, said unto her, using the Spanish liberty
in pronouncing the French,—<i>Madame, vous avez des veaux enfans</i>,
telling her that she had calves to her children, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
saying, <i>beaux enfans</i>, fair children. Neither can I well justify

<p>The Roman Conimbrica stood about two leagues from the
present Coimbra, on the site of Condeyxa Velha. Ataces, king
of the Alanes, won it from the Sueves, and, in revenge for its
obstinate resistance, dispeopled it, making all its inhabitants,
without distinction of persons, work at the foundation of Coimbra
where it now stands. Hermenerico, the king of the Sueves,
attacked him while thus employed, but was defeated and pursued
to the Douro; peace was then made, and Sindasunda, daughter
of the conquered, given in marriage to the conqueror. In
memory of the pacification thus effected, Ataces bore upon his
banners a damsel in a tower, with a dragon vert on one side,
and a lion rouge on the other, the bearings of himself and his
marriage-father; and this device being sculptured upon the
towers of Coimbra, still remains as the city arms. Two letters
of Arisbert, bishop of Porto, to Samerius, archdeacon of Braga,
which are preserved at Alcobaça, relate these events as the
news of the day,—that is, if the authority of Alcobaçan records,
and of Bernardo de Brito can be admitted.—<i>Mon. Lus.</i> 26. 3.</p>

his own; to obtain any proofs upon this subject would be very

admitted, so far as to show that it was a prevalent opinion in
his time.</p>

<p>Antonio Galvam, in his <i>Tratado dos Descobrimentos Antigos
e Modernos</i>, relates a current, and manifestly fabulous story,
which has been supposed to refer to Sacaru, and the companions
of his emigration. “They say,” he says, “that at this time,
A. D. 1447, a Portugueze ship sailing out of the Straits of
Gibraltar, was carried by a storm much farther to the west
than she had intended, and came to an island where there were
seven cities, and where our language was spoken; and the
people asked whether the Moors still occupied Spain, from
whence they had fled after the loss of King Don Rodrigo.
The contramaster of the ship said, that he brought away a little
sand from the island, and sold it to a goldsmith in Lisbon,
who extracted from it a good quantity of gold. It is said that
the Infante D. Pedro, who governed at that time, ordered
these things to be written in the Casa do Tombo. And some
will have it that these lands and islands at which the Portugueze
touched, were those which are now called the Antilhas
and New Spain.” (P. 24.)</p>

<p>This Antilia, or Island of the Seven Cities, is laid down in
Martin Behaim’s map; the story was soon improved by giving
seven bishops to the seven cities: and Galvam has been accused
by Hornius of having invented it to give his countrymen
the honour of having discovered the West Indies! Now it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
evident that Antonio Galvam relates the story as if he did not
believe it,—<i>contam</i>—they relate,—and, <i>diz</i>, it is said,—never
affirming the fact, nor making any inference from it, but
merely stating it as a report: and it is certain, which perhaps
Hornius did not know, that there never lived a man of purer
integrity than Antonio Galvam; a man whose history is disgraceful,
not to his country, but to the government under which
he lived, and whose uniform and unsullied virtue entitles him
to rank among the best men that have ever done honour to
human nature.</p>

<p>The writers who repeat this story of the Seven Islands and
their bishops, have also been pleased to find traces of Sacaru
in the new world, for which the imaginary resemblances to
Christianity which were found in Yucatan and other places,
serve them as proofs.—<i>Gregorio Garcia</i>, <i>Origen de los Indios</i>,
l. iv. c. 20.</p>

<p>The work of Abulcacim, in which the story first appears,
has been roundly asserted to be the forgery of the translator,
Miguel de Luna. The Portugueze academician, Contador de
Argote, speaking of this romantic history, acquits him of the
fraud, which has with little reflection been laid to his charge.
Pedraça, he says, in the Grandezas de Granada, and Rodrigo
Caro, in the Grandezas de Sevilla, both affirm that the original
Arabic exists in the Escurial, and Escolano asserts the same,
although Nicholas Antonio says that the catalogues of that
library do not make mention of any such book. If Luna had
forged it, it would not have had many of those blunders which
are observed in it; nor is there any reason for imputing such
a fraud to Luna, a man well skilled in Arabic, and of good
reputation. What I suspect is, that the book was composed
by a Granadan Moor, and the reason which induces me to form
this opinion is, the minuteness with which he describes the
conquest which Tarif made of those parts of the kingdom of
Granada, of the Alpuxarras and the Serra Neveda, pointing
out the etymologies of the names of places, and other circumstances,
which any one who reads with attention will observe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
As to the time in which the composer of this amusing romance
flourished, it was certainly after the reign of Bedeci Aben
Habuz, who governed, and was Lord of Granada about the
year 1013, as Marmol relates, after the Arabian writers; and
the reason which I have for this assertion is, that in the romance
of Abulcacim the story is told which gave occasion to
the said Bedeci Aben Habuz to set up in Granada that famous
vane, which represents a knight upon horseback in bronze, with
a spear in the right hand, and a club in the left, and these
words in Arabic,—Bedeci Aben Habuz says, that in this
manner Andalusia must be kept! the figure moves with every
wind, and veers about from one end to another.—<i>Memorias de
Braga</i>, t. iii. p. 120.</p>

<p>In the fabulous Chronicle of D. Rodrigo, Sacarus, as he is
there called, is a conspicuous personage; but the tale of his
emigration was not then current, and the author kills him before
the Moors appear upon the stage. He seems to have
designed him as a representation of perfect generosity.</p>

observing in his edict, that the people ought in no slight degree
to rejoice at the repeal. It is curious that the distinction
should have existed so long; but it is found also in a law of
Wamba’s, and doubtless must have continued till both names
were lost together in the general wreck. The vile principle
was laid down in the laws of the Wisigoths, that such as the
root is, such ought the branch to be,—<i>gran confusion es de
linage, quando el fiyo non semeya al padre, que aquelo ques de la<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>

to keep the children of slaves, slaves also.</p>

<p>“Many men well versed in history,” says Contador de Argote,
(Memorias de Braga, 3. 273.) “think, and think rightly,
that this was a civil war, and that the monarchy was divided
into two factions, of which the least powerful availed itself of
the Arabs as auxiliaries; and that these auxiliaries made themselves
masters, and easily effected their intent by means of the
divisions in the country.”</p>

<p>“The natives of Spain,” says Joam de Barros, “never bore
much love to the Goths, who were strangers and comelings,
and when they came had no right there, for the whole belonged
to the Roman empire. It is believed that the greater part of
those whom the Moors slew were Goths, and it is said that,
on one side and on the other, in the course of two years there
were slain by the sword seven hundred thousand men. The
Christians who escaped chose that the name of Goths should
be lost: and though some Castillians complain that the race
should be extinguished, saying with Don Jorge Manrique,</p>

<p>I must say that I see no good foundation for this; for
they were a proud nation and barbarous, and were a long
time heretics of the sects of Arius and Eutychius and Pelagius,
and can be praised as nothing except as warriors, who
were so greedy for dominion, that wherever they reached they
laid every thing bare like locusts, and therefore the emperor
ceded to them this country. The people who dwelt in it
before were a better race, always praised and feared and respected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
by the Romans, loyal and faithful and true and reasonable:
and if the Goths afterwards were worthy of any
estimation they became so here: for as plants lose their
bitterness and improve by being planted and translated into a
good soil (as is said of peaches), so does a good land change its
inhabitants, and of rustic and barbarous make them polished
and virtuous.</p>

<p>“The Moors did not say that they came against the Christians,
but against the Goths, who had usurped Spain; and it
appears that to the people of the land it mattered little whether
they were under Goths or Moors; or indeed it might not be
too much to say that they preferred the Moors, not only because
all new things and changes would be pleasing, but
because they were exasperated against the Goths for what they
had done against the Christians, (<i>i. e.</i> the Catholicks,) and for
the bad government of King Witiza.”</p>

<p>“You are not to think,” says the Chronicler, “that Count
Don Julian and the Bishop Don Orpas came of the lineage of
the Goths, but of the lineage of the Cæsars, and therefore they
were not grieved that the good lineage should be destroyed.”—<i>Chr.

<p>For this fact there is the unquestionable testimony of Isidorus
Pacensis. <i>Per idem tempus in Æra 735, anno imperii
ejus 9. Arabum 97. Abdalaziz omnem Hispaniam per tres annos
sub censuario jugo pacificans, cum Hispali divitiis et honorum
fascibus cum Regina Hispaniæ in conjugio copulata, filias Regum
ac Principum pellicatas, et imprudenter distractas æstuaret, seditione

Ruderici regis, quam sibi sociaberat, jugum Arabicum a sua cervice
conaretur avertere, et regnum in vasum Hiberiæ sibimet retemptare.</i>—Espana
Sagrada, t. viii. 302.</p>

<p>Florez relates the story in the words of the old translation
of an Arabic original imputed to Rasis. “When Belazin, the
son of Muza, remained for Lord of Spain, and had ordered his
affairs right well, they told him tidings of Ulaca, who had
been the wife of King D. Rodrigo, that she was a right
worthy dame, and right beautiful, and of a great lineage, and
that she was a native of Africa; whereupon he sent for her,
and ordered that beasts should be given her, and much property,
and men-servants and maid-servants, and all things that
she could require, till she could come to him. And they
brought her unto him, and when he saw her, he was well
pleased with her, and said, Ulaca, tell me of thy affairs, and
conceal nothing from me; for thou knowest I may do with
thee according to my will, being my captive. And when she
heard this, it increased the grief which she had in her heart,
and her sorrow was such, that she had well nigh fallen dead to
the ground, and she replied weeping and said, Baron, what
wouldst thou know more of my affairs? For doth not all the
world know, that I, a young damsel, being married with King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
D. Rodrigo, was with him Lady of Spain, and dwelt in
honour and in all pleasure, more than I deserved; and therefore
it was God’s will that they should endure no longer. And
now I am in dishonour greater than ever was dame of such
high state: For I am plundered, and have not a single palm
of inheritance; and I am a captive, and brought into bondage.
I also have been mistress of all the land that I behold. Therefore,
Sir, have pity upon my misfortunes; and in respect of
the great lineage which you know to be mine, suffer not that
wrong or violence be offered me by any one; and, Sir, if it
be your grace you will ransom me. There are men I know
who would take compassion on me, and give you for me a
great sum. And Belazin said to her, Be certain that so long
as I live, you shall never go from my house. And Ulaca said,
What then, Sir, would you do with me? and Belazin said, I
will that you should remain in my house, and there you shall be
free from all wretchedness, with my other wives. And she said,
In an evil day was I born, if it is to be true that I have been
wife of the honoured king of Spain, and now have to live in a
stranger’s house as the concubine and captive of another! And
I swear unto God, whose pleasure it is to dismay me thus, that
I will rather seek my own death as soon as I can; for I will
endure no more misery, seeing that by death I can escape it.
And when Belazin saw that she thus lamented, he said to her,
Good dame, think not that we have concubines, but by our law
we may have seven wives, if we can maintain them, and therefore
you shall be my wife, like each of the others; and all
things which your law requires that a man should do for his wife,
will I do for you; and therefore you have no cause to lament;
and be sure that I will do you much honour, and will make all
who love me serve and honour you, and you shall be mistress
of all my wives. To this she made answer and said, Sir, offer
me no violence concerning my law, but let me live as a
Christian: And to this Belazin was nothing loth and he
granted it, and his marriage was performed with her according
to the law of the Moors; and every day he liked her
more, and did her such honour that greater could not be.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
And it befell that Belazin being one day with Ulaca, she said
to him, Sir, do not think it ill if I tell you of a thing in
which you do not act as if you knew the custom. And he
said, Wherein is it that I err? Sir, said she, because you have
no crown, for no one was ever confirmed in Spain, except
he had a crown upon his head. He said, This which you say
is nothing, for we have it not of our lineage, neither is it our
custom to wear a crown. She said, many good reasons are
there why a crown is of use, and it would injure you nothing,
but be well for you, and when you should wear your crown
upon your head, God would know you and others also by it:
And she said, You would look full comely with it, and it
would be great nobleness to you, and be right fitting, and you
should wear in it certain stones, which will be good for you,
and avail you. And in a short time afterwards Belazin went
to dwell at Seville, and he carried Ulaca with him, and she
took of her gold, and of her pearls, and of her precious stones,
which she had many and good, and made him the noblest
crown that ever was seen by man, and gave it him, and bade
him take it, and place it where it should be well kept; and
Ulaca, as she was a woman of understanding and prudence,
ordered her affairs as well as Belazin, so that he loved her
much, and did great honour to her, and did many of those
things which she desired; so that he was well pleased with the
Christians, and did them much good, and showed favour
unto them.”—<i>Memorias de las Reynas Catholicas</i>, 1. p. 28.</p>

<p>The issue of this was fatal to Abdalaziz. In Albucacim’s
history, it is said that he was converted by this Christian wife,
and for that reason put to death by his father. Others have
supposed that by means of her influence he was endeavouring
to make himself King of Spain, independent of the Caliph.
A characteristic circumstance is added. Egilona was very
desirous to convert her husband, and that she might at least
obtain from him some mark of outward respect for her images,
made the door of the apartment in which she kept them,
so low, that he could not enter without bowing.—<i>Bleda</i>,
p. 214.</p>

<p>This was a favourite opinion of Garibays, himself a Biscayan,
but he has little better proof for it than the fact, that
Gothic names disappeared with Roderick, and that Pelayo
and his successors drew their nomenclature from a different
stock. He says, indeed, that ancient writings are not wanting
to support his opinion. Some rude commentator has written
against this assertion in the margin of my copy, <i>miente Garibay</i>;
and I am afraid the commentator is the truer man of
the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>There is a fabulous tale of Pelayo’s birth, which, like many
other tales of no better authority, has legends and relics to
support it. The story, according to Dr. D. Christoval Lozano,
in his history of Los Reyes Nuevos de Toledo, is this. Luz,
niece to Egilona, and sister of Roderick, dwelt at Toledo, in
the palace of King Egica. Duke Favila, her father’s brother,
fell in love with her, and came from his residence in Cantabria
to ask her in marriage, expecting to find no other
obstacle than the dispensable one of consanguinity. But it so
happened, that the King was wooing Luz to become his concubine;
her refusal made him jealous, as he could not conceive
that it proceeded from any cause except love for another, and
as his temper and power were not to be provoked without
danger, Favila dared not openly make his suit. He and his
mistress therefore met in private, and plighted their vows
before an image of the Virgin. The consequences soon
became apparent,—the more so, because, as Dr Lozano assures
us, there were at that time no fashions to conceal such
things,—<i>Y mas que en aquella era no se avian inventado los
guarda-infantes</i>. The king observed the alteration in her
shape, and placed spies upon her, meaning to destroy the
child and punish the mother with the rigour of the law, death
by fire being the punishment for such an offence. Luz was
well aware of the danger. She trusted her <i>Camarera</i> and one
servant: They made an ark: She herself, as soon as the
infant was born, threw water in his face, and baptised him by
the name of Pelayo: a writing was placed with him in the
ark, requesting that whoever should find it would breed up
the boy with care, for he was of good lineage. Money enough
was added to support him for eight years, and the ark was
then launched upon the Tagus, where it floated down the
stream all night, all day, and all the following night. On the
second morning it grounded near Alcantara, and was found
by Grafeses, who happened to be Luz’s uncle. The king’s
suspicion being confirmed by the sudden alteration in the
lady’s appearance, he used every means to detect her, but
without avail; he even ordered all children to be examined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
who had been born in or around Toledo within three months,
and full enquiry to be made into the circumstances of their
births: To the astonishment of later historians, 35,000 of
that age were found, and not one among them of suspicious
extraction. The tale proceeds in the ordinary form of romance.
The lady is accused of incontinence, and to be burnt, unless
a champion defeats her accuser. Favila of course undertakes
her defence, and of course is victorious. A second battle
follows with the same success, and fresh combats would have
followed, if a hermit had not brought the king to repentance.
Grafeses in due time discovers the secret, and restores the
child to his parents.</p>

<p>This fabulous chronicle seems to be the oldest written source
of this story, but some such tradition had probably long been
current. The ark was shown at Alcantara, in the convent of
St. Benito, and a description of it, with reasons why its
authenticity should be admitted, may be found in <i>Francisco de
Pisa’s Description de Toledo</i>, l. iii. c. i.</p>

<p>Garci Fernandez Manrique surprised the Moors so often

<p>Mariana derives the name of Hermesinda from the reverence
in which Hermenegild was held in Spain,—a prince who has
been sainted for having renounced the Homooisian creed, and
raised a civil war against his father in favour of the Homoousian
one. It is not a little curious when the fate of
D. Carlos is remembered, that his name should have been
inserted in the Kalendar, at the solicitation of Philip II.!
From the same source Mariana derives the names Hermenisinda,
Armengol, Ermengaud, Hermegildez, and Hermildez.
But here, as Brito has done with Pelayo, he seems to forget
that the name was current before it was borne by the Saint,
and the derivations from it as numerous. Its root may be
found in Herman, whose German name will prevail over the
latinized Arminius.</p>

<p>The story of the Enchanted Tower at Toledo is well known
to every English reader. It neither accorded with the character
of my poem to introduce the fiction, nor would it have
been prudent to have touched upon it after Walter Scott.
The account of the Archbishop Rodrego, and of Abulcacim,
may be found in his notes. What follows here is translated
from the fabulous chronicle of King Don Rodrigo.</p>

<p>“And there came to him the keepers of the house which
was in Toledo, which they called Pleasure with Pain, the
Perfect Guard, the secret of that which is to come; and it
was called also by another name, the Honour of God. And
these keepers came before the king, and said unto him, Sire,
since God hath done thee such good, and such favour as that
thou shouldest be king of all Spain, we come to require of
thee that thou wouldst go to Toledo, and put thy lock upon
the house which we are appointed to keep. And the king
demanded of them what house was that, and wherefore he
should put upon it his lock. And they said unto him, Sire,
we will willingly tell thee that thou mayest know. Sire, true
it is, that when Hercules the Strong came into Spain, he made
in it many marvellous things in those places where he understood
that they might best remain; and thus when he was in
Toledo he understood well that that city would be one of the
best in Spain; and saw that the kings who should be Lords
of Spain, would have more pleasure to continue dwelling
therein than in any other part; and seeing that things would
come after many ways, some contrariwise to others, it pleased
him to leave many enchantments made, to the end that after
his death his power and wisdom might by them be known.
And he made in Toledo a house, after the manner which we
shall now describe, with great mastership, so that we have not
heard tell of any other such: The which is made after this
guise. There are four lions of metal under the foundation
of this house: and so large are they that a man sitting upon
a great horse on the one side, and another in like manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
upon the other, cannot see each other, so large are the lions.
And the house is upon them, and it is entirely round, and so
lofty that there is not a man in the world who can throw a
stone to the top: And many have attempted this, but they
never could. And there is not a man of this age who can
tell you by what manner this house was made, neither whose
understanding can reach to say in what manner it is worked
within. But of that which we have seen without, we have
to tell thee. Certes in the whole house there is no stone
bigger than the hand of a man, and the most of them are of
jasper and marble, so clear and shining that they seem to be
crystal. They are of so many colours that we do not think
there are two stones in it of the same colour; and so cunningly
are they joined one with another, that if it were not
for the many colours, you would not believe but that the
whole house was made of one entire stone. And the stones
are placed in such manner one by another, that seeing them
you may know all the things of the battles aforepast, and of
great feats. And this is not by pictures, but the colour of the
stones, and the great art of joining one with the other, make
it appear thus. And sans doubt he who should wish to know
the truth of the great deeds of arms which have been wrought
in the world, might by means of that house know it. See
now in what manner Hercules was wise and fortunate, and
right valiant, and acquainted with the things which were to
come. And when he was Lord of Spain, he made it after
this guise, which we have related unto you. And he commanded
that neither King nor Lord of Spain who might come
after him, should seek to know that which was within; but
that every one instead should put a lock upon the doors
thereof, even as he himself did, for he first put on a lock, and
fastened it with his key. And after him there has been no
King nor Lord in Spain, who has thought it good to go from
his bidding; but every one as he came put on each his lock,
according to that which Hercules appointed. And now that
we have told thee the manner of the house, and that which
we know concerning it, we require of thee that thou shouldest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
go thither, and put on thy lock on the gates thereof, even as
all the kings have done who have reigned in Spain until this
time. And the King Don Rodrigo hearing the marvellous
things of this house, and desiring to know what there was
within, and moreover being a man of a great heart, wished to
know of all things how they were and for what guise. He
made answer, that no such lock would he put upon that house,
and that by all means he would know what there was within.
And they said unto him, Sire, you will not do that which has
never been done in Spain; be pleased therefore to observe
that which the other kings have observed. And the king said
unto them, Leave off now, and I will appoint the soonest that
may be how I may go to see this house, and then I will do
that which shall seem good. And he would give them no
other reply. And when they saw that he would give them
no other reply, they dared not persist farther, and they dispeeded
themselves of him, and went their way.</p>

<p>“Now it came to pass that the King Don Rodrigo called to
mind how he had been required to put a lock upon the doors
of the house which was in Toledo, and he resolved to carry
into effect that unto which his heart inclined him. And one
day he gathered together all the greatest knights of Spain,
who were there with him, and went to see this house, and he
saw that it was more marvellous than those who were its
keepers had told him, and as he was thus beholding it, he said,
Friends, I will by all means see what there is in this house
which Hercules made. And when the great Lords who were
with him heard this, they began to say unto him that he ought
not to do this; for there was no reason why he should do that
which never king nor Cæsar, that had been Lord of Spain
since Hercules, had done until that time. And the king said
unto them, Friends, in this house there is nothing but what
may be seen. I am well sure that the enchantments cannot
hinder me, and this being so, I have nothing to fear. And the
knights said, Do that, sir, which you think good, but this is
not done by our counsel. And when he saw that they were all
of a different accord from that which he wished to do, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
Now gainsay me as you will, for let what will happen I shall
not forbear to do my pleasure. And forthwith he went to the
doors, and ordered all the locks to be opened; and this was a
great labour, for so many were the keys and the locks, that if
they had not seen it, it would have been a great thing to believe.
And after they were unlocked, the king pushed the
door with his hand, and he went in, and the chief persons who
were there with him, as many as he pleased, and they found a
hall made in a square, being as wide on one part as on the
other, and in it there was a bed richly furnished, and there
was laid in that bed the statue of a man, exceeding great, and
armed at all points, and he had the one arm stretched out, and
a writing in his hand. And when the king and those who
were with him saw this bed, and the man who was laid in it,
they marvelled what it might be, and they said, Certes, that
bed was one of the wonders of Hercules and of his enchantments.
And when they saw the writing which he held in his
hand, they showed it to the king, and the king went to him,
and took it from his hand, and opened it and read it, and it
said thus, Audacious one, thou who shalt read this writing,
mark well what thou art, and how great evil through thee shall
come to pass, for even as Spain was peopled and conquered by
me, so by thee shall it be depopulated and lost. And I say
unto thee, that I was Hercules the strong, he who conquered
the greater part of the world, and all Spain; and I slew Geryon
the Great, who was Lord thereof; and I alone subdued
all these lands of Spain, and conquered many nations, and
brave knights, and never any one could conquer me, save only
Death. Look well to what thou doest, for from this world
thou wilt carry with thee nothing but the good which thou
hast done.</p>

<p>“And when the king had read the writing he was troubled,
and he wished then that he had not begun this thing. Howbeit
he made semblance as if it touched him not, and said that
no man was powerful enough to know that which is to come,
except the true God. And all the knights who were present
were much troubled because of what the writing said; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
having seen this they went to behold another apartment, which
was so marvellous, that no man can relate how marvellous it
was. The colours which were therein were four. The one
part of the apartment was white as snow; and the other,
which was over-against it, was more black than pitch; and
another part was green as a fine emerald, and that which was
over-against it was redder than fresh blood; and the whole
apartment was bright and more lucid than crystal, and it was
so beautiful, and the colour thereof so fine, that it seemed as if
each of the sides were made of a single stone, and all who were
there present said that there was not more than a single stone
in each, and that there was no joining of one stone with another,
for every side of the whole four appeared to be one solid slab;
and they all said, that never in the world had such a work as
this elsewhere been made, and that it must be held for a remarkable
thing, and for one of the wonders of the world.
And in all the apartments there was no beam, nor any work of
wood, neither within nor without; and as the floor thereof was
flat, so also was the ceiling. Above these were windows, and
so many, that they gave a great light, so that all which was
within might be seen as clearly as that which was without.
And when they had seen the apartment how it was made, they
found in it nothing but one pillar, and that not very large,
and round, and of the height of a man of mean stature: and
there was a door in it right cunningly made, and upon it was
a little writing in Greek letters, which said, Hercules made
this house in the year of Adam three hundred and six. And
when the king had read these letters, and understood that
which they said, he opened the door, and when it was opened
they found Hebrew letters which said, This house is one of the
wonders of Hercules; and when they had read these letters
they saw a niche made in that pillar, in which was a coffer of
silver, right subtly wrought, and after a strange manner, and
it was gilded, and covered with many precious stones, and of
great price, and it was fastened with a lock of mother-of-pearl.
And this was made in such a manner that it was a strange
thing, and there were cut upon it Greek letters which said, It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
cannot be but that the king, in whose time this coffer shall be
opened, shall see wonders before his death: thus said Hercules
the Lord of Greece and of Spain, who knew some of those
things which are to come. And when the king understood
this, he said, Within this coffer lies that which I seek to know,
and which Hercules has so strongly forbidden to be known.
And he took the lock and broke it with his hands, for there
was no other who durst break it: and when the lock was
broken, and the coffer open, they found nothing within, except
a white cloth folded between two pieces of copper; and he
took it and opened it, and found Moors pourtrayed therein
with turbans, and banners in their hands and with their swords
round their necks, and their bows behind them at the saddle-bow,
and over these figures were letters which said, When this
cloth shall be opened, and these figures seen, men apparelled
like them shall conquer Spain and shall be Lords thereof.</p>

<p>“When the King Don Rodrigo saw this he was troubled at
heart, and all the knights who were with him. And they said
unto him, Now, sir, you may see what has befallen you, because
you would not listen to those who counselled you not to
pry into so great a thing, and because you despised the kings
who were before you, who all observed the commands of Hercules,
and ordered them to be observed, but you would not do
this. And he had greater trouble in his heart than he had
ever before felt; howbeit he began to comfort them all, and
said to them, God forbid that all this which we have seen
should come to pass. Nevertheless, I say, that if things must
be according as they are here declared, I could not set aside
that which hath been ordained, and, therefore, it appears that
I am he by whom this house was to be opened, and that for
me it was reserved. And seeing it is done, there is no reason
that we should grieve for that which cannot be prevented, if it
must needs come. And let come what may, with all my
power I will strive against that which Hercules has foretold,
even till I take my death in resisting it: and if you will all do
in like manner, I doubt whether the whole world can take
from us our power. But if by God it hath been appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
no strength and no art can avail against his Almighty power,
but that all things must be fulfilled even as to him seemeth
good. In this guise they went out of the house, and he
charged them all that they should tell no man of what they
had seen there, and ordered the doors to be fastened in the
same manner as before. And they had hardly finished fastening
them, when they beheld an eagle fall right down from the
sky, as if it had descended from Heaven, carrying a burning
fire-brand, which it laid upon the top of the house, and began
to fan it with its wings: and the fire-brand with the motion of
the air began to blaze, and the house was kindled and burnt as
if it had been made of rosin; so strong and mighty were the
flames and so high did they blaze up, that it was a great marvel,
and it burnt so long that there did not remain the sign of a
single stone, and all was burnt into ashes. And after a while
there came a great flight of birds small and black, who hovered
over the ashes, and they were so many, that with the fanning
of their wings, all the ashes were stirred up, and rose into the
air, and were scattered over the whole of Spain; and many of
those persons upon whom the ashes fell, appeared as if they
had been besmeared with blood. All this happened in a day,
and many said afterwards, that all those persons upon whom
those ashes fell, died in battle when Spain was conquered and
lost; and this was the first sign of the destruction of Spain.”—<i>Chronica
del Rey D. Rodrigo</i>, Part I. c. 28. 30.</p>

<p>“<i>Y siendo verdad lo que escriven nuestros Chronistas, y el
Alcayde Tarif, las letras que en este Palacio fueron halladas, no
se ha de entender que fueron puestas por Hercules en su fundacion,
ni por algun nigromantico, como algunos piensan, pues solo
Dios sabe las cosas por venir, y aquellos aquien el es servido revelarlas:
bien puede ser que fuessen puestas por alguna santa
persona aquien nuestro Señor lo oviesse revelado y mandado;
como revelo el castigo que avia de suceder del diluvio general en
tiempo de Noe, que fue pregonero de la justicia de Dios; y el
de las ciudades de Sodoma y Gomorra a Abraham.</i>”—Fran. de
Pisa, Descr. de Toledo, l. 2. c. 31.</p>

<p>The <i>Chronica General del Rey Don Alfonso</i> gives a singular
account of the first inhabitant of this fatal spot:—</p>

<p>“There was a king who had to name Rocas; he was of
the east country from Edom, wherein was Paradise, and for
the love of wisdom he forsook his kingdom, and went about
the world seeking knowledge. And in a country between the
east and the north he found seventy pillars; thirty were of
brass, thirty of marble, and they lay upon the ground, and
upon them was written all knowledge and the nature of things.
These Rocas translated, and carried with him the book in
which he had translated them, by which he did marvels. He
came to Troy when the people under Laomedon were building
the city, and seeing them he laughed. They asked him why,
and he replied, that if they knew what was to happen, they
would cease from their work. Then they took him and led
him before Laomedon, and Laomedon asked him for why he
had spoken these words, and Rocas answered, that he had
spoken truth, for the people should be put to the sword,
and the city be destroyed by fire. Wherefore the Trojans
would have slain him, but Laomedon, judging that he spake
from folly, put him in prison to see if he would repent. He,
fearful of death, by his art sent a sleep upon the guards, and
filed off his irons, and went his way. And he came to the
seven hills by the Tyber, and there upon a stone he wrote
the letters Roma, and Romulus found them, and gave them as a
name to his city, because they bore a resemblance to his own.</p>

<p>“Then went King Rocas westward, and he entered Spain,
and went round it and through it, till coming to the spot
where Toledo stands, he discovered that it was the central
place of the country, and that one day a city should there be
built, and there he found a cave into which he entered. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
lay in it a huge dragon, and Rocas in fear besought the dragon
not to hurt him, for they were both creatures of God. And
the dragon took such love towards him, that he always brought
him part of his food from the chase, and they dwelt together
in the cave. One day an honourable man of that land, by
name Tartus, was hunting in that mountain, and he found a
bear, and the bear fled into the cave, and Rocas in fear addressed
him as he had done the dragon, and the bear quietly
lay down, and Rocas fondled his head, and Tartus following,
saw Rocas how his beard was long, and his body covered with
hair, and he thought it was a wild man, and fitted an arrow
to his bow, and drew the string. Then Rocas besought him
in the name of God not to slay him, and obtained security for
himself and the bear under his protection. And when Tartus
heard how he was a king, he invited him to leave that den and
return with him, and he would give him his only daughter in
marriage, and leave him all that he had. By this the dragon
returned. Tartus was alarmed, and would have fled, but
Rocas interfered, and the dragon threw down half an ox, for
he had devoured the rest, and asked the stranger to stop and
eat. Tartus declined the invitation, for he must be gone.
Then said Rocas to the dragon, My friend, I must now leave
you, for we have sojourned together long enough. So he departed,
and married, and had two sons, and for love of the
dragon he built a tower over the cave, and dwelt there. After
his death, one of his sons built another, and King Pirros added
more building, and this was the beginning of Toledo.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Redeemed Magdalen.</i>—<a href="#Page_97">X. p. 97.</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lardner published a letter to Jonas Hanway, showing why
houses for the reception of penitent harlots ought not to be
called Magdalen Houses; Mary Magdalen not being the sinner
recorded in the 7th chapter of Luke, but a woman of distinction
and excellent character, who laboured under some
bodily infirmity, which our Lord miraculously healed.</p>

<p>In the Shibboleth of Jean Despagne, is an article thus entitled:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
<i>De Marie Magdelaine laquelle faussement on dit avoir
este femme de mauvaise vie: Le tort que luy font les Theologiens
pour la plus part en leurs sermons, en leurs livres; et specialement
la Bible Angloise en l’Argument du 7ᵉ chap. de S. Luc</i>.</p>

<p>“The injury,” says this Hugonot divine, “which the
Romish church does to another Mary, the sister of Lazarus,
has been sufficiently confuted by the orthodox. It has been
ignorantly believed that this Mary, and another who was of
Magdala, and the sinner who is spoken of in the 7th of Luke,
are the same person, confounding the three in one. We have
justified one of the three, to wit, her of Bethany, the sister of
Lazarus; but her of Magdala we still defame, as if that Magdalen
were the sinner of whom St. Luke speaks.</p>

<p>“Nothing is more common in the mouth of the vulgar than
the wicked life of the Magdalen. The preachers who wish
to confess souls that are afflicted with horror at their sins, represent
to them this woman as one of the most immodest and
dissolute that ever existed, to whom, however, God has shown
mercy. And, upon this same prejudice, which is altogether
imaginary, has been founded a reason why the Son of God
having been raised from the dead, appeared to Mary Magdalen
before any other person; for, say they, it is because
she had greater need of consolation, having been a greater
sinner than the others.—He who wrote the Practice of Piety
places her with the greatest offenders, even with Manasses,
one of the wickedest of men: and to authorise this error the
more, it has been inserted in the Bible itself. For the argument
to the 7th of Luke in the English version says, that the
woman whose sins were in greater number than those of
others,—the woman, who till then had lived a wicked and
infamous life, was Mary Magdalen. But, <i>1st</i>, The text gives
no name to this sinner: Where then has it been found?
Which of the Evangelists, or what other authentic writing,
has taught us the proper name or surname of the woman?
For she who poured an ointment upon Christ (Matth. xxvi.
John, xii.) was not this sinner, nor Mary Magdalen, but a
sister of Lazarus. All these circumstances show that they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
two different stories, two divers actions, performed at divers
times, in divers places, and by divers persons. <i>2dly</i>, Where do
we find that Mary Magdalen ever anointed the feet of our Saviour?
<i>3dly</i>, Where do we find that Mary Magdalen had been
a woman of evil life? The gospel tells us that she had been tormented
with seven devils or evil spirits, an affliction which might
happen to the holiest person in the world: But we do not see
even the shadow of a word there which marks her with infamy.
Why then do we still adhere to an invention not only fabulous,
but injurious to the memory of a woman illustrious in piety?
We ought as well to beware of bearing false witness against the
dead as against the living.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable that neither the sinner (Luke, vii.) nor
the adultress who is spoken of in the 8th of John, are named
in the sacred history, any more than the thief who was converted
on the cross. There are particular reasons, beyond a
doubt, and we may in part conjecture them, why the Holy
Spirit has abstained from relating the names of these great
sinners, although converted. It is not then for us to impose
them; still less to appropriate them to persons whom the
Scripture does not accuse of any enormous sins.”</p>

<p>St. Mary the Egyptian. This is one of those religious romances
which may probably have been written to edify the
people without any intention of deceiving them. Some parts of
the legend are beautifully conceived. An English Romanist
has versified it in eight books, under the title of the Triumph
of the Cross, or Penitent of Egypt. Birmingham, 1776. He

<p>It is thus related in the fabulous Chronicle:—“<i>Despues
que el Rey ovo descubierto su coraçon a la Cava, no era dia que
la no requiriesse una vez o dos, y ella se defendia con buena
razon: empero al cabo como el Rey no pensava cosa como en esto,
un dia en la siesta embio con un donzel suyo por la Cava; y ella
vino a su mandado; y como en essa hora no avia en toda su
camara otro ninguno sino ellos todos tres, el cumplio con ella todo
lo que puso. Empero tanto sabed que si ella quisiera dar bozes
que bien fuera oyda de la reyna, mas callosse con lo que el Rey
quiso fazer</i>.”—P. 1. c. 172.</p>

<p>In this fabulous Chronicle Roderick’s fall is represented as
the work of his stars:—“<i>Y aunque a las vezes pensava el gran
yerro en que tocava, y en la maldad que su coraçon avia cometido,
tanto era el ardor que tenia que lo olvidava todo, y esto acarreava
la malandança que le avia de venir, y la destruycion de Espana
que avia de aver comienço para se hazer; y quiero vos dezir que
su constelacion no podia escusar que esto no passasse assi; y ya
Dios lo avia dexado en su discrecion; y el por cosa que fuesse on
se podia arredrar que no topasse en ello.</i>”—P. 1. c. 164.</p>

<p>“Certes,” says the fabulous Chronicler, “he was a Lord of
greater bounty than ever had been seen before his time.—He
used to say, that if all the world were his, he would rather lose
it than one friend; for the world was a thing, which if it were
lost, might be recovered; but a friend once lost could never
be recovered for all the treasure in the world. And because
he was thus bountiful, all those of Spain were likewise; and
they had the fame of being the most liberal men in the world,
especially those of the lineage of the Goths. Never a thing
was asked at his hands, whether great or small, to which he
could say no; and never king nor other great lord asked aid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
of him that he denied, but gave them of his treasures and of
his people as much as they needed. And doubt not, but that
if fortune had not ordered that in his time the lineage of the
Goths should be cut off, and Spain destroyed, there was no
king or emperor whom he would not have brought into subjection;
and if the whole world ought to be placed in the
power of one man, (speaking of worldly things,) there never
was, nor will be, a man deserving to possess it, save he alone.
But as envy is the beginning of all evil, and saw how great
was the goodness of this king, she never rested till she had
brought about that things should be utterly reversed, even till
she had destroyed him. Oh what great damage to the world
will it be when God shall consent that so much bounty, and
courage, and frankness, and loyalty should be destroyed for
ever! All nations ought to clad themselves in wretched weeds
one day in the week to mourn for the flower of the world, and
especially ought the people of Spain to make such mourning.”—<i>Chronica
del Rey Don Rodrigo</i>, p. 1. c. 55.</p>

<p>And again, when the last battle is approaching, he praises
the king:—“<i>Y el Rey era el mas esforçado hombre de coraçon
que nunca se oyo dezir: y el mas franco de todo lo que podia
aver; y preciava mas cobrar amigos que no quanto tesoro pudiesse
estar en su reyno, hasta el dia que creyo el consejo del traydor del
conde Don Julian; y a maravilla era buen cavallero que al tiempo
que el no era rey, no se hallava cavallero que a la su bondad se
ygualasse, y tanto sabed que sino por estas malandanças que le
vinieron, nunca cavallero al mundo de tales condiciones fue; que
nunca a el vino chico ni grande que del se partiesse despagado a
culpa suya</i>.”—P. 1. c. 213.</p>

<p>The Partidas have some curious matter upon this subject.</p>

<p>“Cleanliness makes things appear well to those who behold
them, even as propriety makes them seemly, each in its way.
And therefore the ancients held it good that knights should be
made cleanly. For even as they ought to have cleanliness
within them in their manners and customs, so ought they to
have it without in their garments, and in the arms which they
wear. For albeit their business is hard and cruel, being to
strike and to slay; yet notwithstanding they may not so far
forego their natural inclinations, as not to be pleased with fair
and goodly things, especially when they wear them. For on
one part they give joy and delight, and on the other make them
fearlessly perform feats of arms, because they are aware that by
them they are known, and that because of them men take
more heed to what they do. Therefore, for this reason, cleanliness
and propriety do not diminish the hardihood and cruelty
which they ought to have. Moreover, as is aforesaid, that
which appears without is the signification of what they have in
their inclinations within. And therefore the ancients ordained
that the squire, who is of noble lineage, should keep vigil the
day before he receives knighthood. And after mid-day the
squires shall bathe him, and wash his head with their hands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
and lay him in the goodliest bed that may be. And there the
knights shall draw on his hose, and clothe him with the best
garments that can be had. And when the cleansing of the
body has been performed, they shall do as much to the soul,
taking him to the church, where he is to labour in watching
and beseeching mercy of God, that he will forgive him his sins,
and guide him so that he may demean himself well in that
order which he is about to receive; to the end that he may
defend his law, and do all other things according as it behoveth
him, and that he would be his defender and keeper in all
dangers and in all difficulties. And he ought to bear in mind
how God is powerful above all things, and can show his power
in them when he listeth, and especially in affairs of arms.
For in his hand are life and death, to give and to take away,
and to make the weak strong, and the strong weak. And
when he is making this prayer, he must be with his knees
bent, and all the rest of the time on foot, as long as he can
bear it. For the vigil of knights was not ordained to be a
sport, nor for any thing else, except that they, and those who
go there, should pray to God to protect them, and direct them
in the right way, and support them, as men who are entering
upon the way of death.”—<i>Part. ii. Tit. 21. Ley 13.</i></p>

<p>“When the vigil is over, as soon as it is day, he ought first
to hear mass, and pray God to direct all his feats to his service.
And afterwards he who is to knight him shall come and ask
him, if he would receive the order of knighthood; and if he
answereth yea, then shall it be asked him, if he will maintain
it as it ought to be maintained; and when he shall have
promised to do this, that knight shall fasten on his spurs, or
order some other knight to fasten them on, according to what
manner of man he may be, and the rank which he holdeth.
And this they do to signify, that as a knight putteth spurs on
the right and on the left, to make his horse gallop straight forward,
even so he ought to let his actions be straight forward,
swerving on neither side. And then shall his sword be girt on
over his <i>brial</i>.—Formerly it was ordained that when noble men
were made knights, they should be armed at all points, as if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
they were about to do battle. But it was not held good that
their heads should be covered, for they who cover their heads
do so for two reasons: the one to hide something there which
hath an ill look, and for that reason they may well cover them
with any fair and becoming covering. The other reason is,
when a man hath done some unseemly thing of which he is
ashamed. And this in no wise becometh noble knights. For
when they are about to receive so noble and so honourable a
thing as knighthood, it is not fitting that they should enter
into it with any evil shame, neither with fear. And when
they shall have girded on his sword, they shall draw it from
out the scabbard, and place it in his right hand, and make him
swear these three things: first, That he shall not fear to die
for his faith, if need be; secondly, For his natural Lord;
thirdly, For his country; and when he hath sworn this, then
shall the blow on the neck be given him, in order that these
things aforesaid may come into his mind, saying, God guard
him to his service, and let him perform all that he hath promised;
and after this, he who hath conferred the order upon
him, shall kiss him, in token of the faith and peace and brotherhood
which ought to be observed among knights. And the
same ought all the knights to do who are in that place, not
only at that time, but whenever they shall meet with him
during that whole year.”—<i>Part. ii. Tit. 21. Ley 14.</i></p>

<p>“The gilt spurs which the knights put on have many significations;
for the gold, which is so greatly esteemed, he
puts upon his feet, denoting thereby, that the knight shall not
for gold commit any malignity or treason, or like deed, that
would detract from the honour of knighthood. The spurs
are sharp, that they may quicken the speed of the horse; and
this signifies that the knight ought to spur and prick on the
people, and make them virtuous; for one knight with his
virtues is sufficient to make many people virtuous, and on the
other hand, he ought to prick a perverse people to make them
fearful.”—<i>Tirante il Blanco</i>, p. 1. C. 19. ff. 44.</p>

<p>The Hermit reads to Tirante a chapter from the <i>Arbor de
battaglie</i> explaining the origin of knighthood. The world, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
is there said, was corrupted, when God, to the intent that he
might be loved, honoured, served, and feared once more,
chose out from every thousand men one who was more amiable,
more affable, more wise, more loyal, more strong, more noble-minded,
more virtuous, and of better customs than all the
others: And then he sought among all beasts for that which
was the goodliest, and the swiftest, and which could bear the
greatest fatigue, and might be convenient for the service of
man; and he chose the horse, and gave him to this man who
was chosen from the thousand; and for this reason he was
called <i>cavallero</i>, because the best animal was thus joined to
the most noble man. And when Romulus founded Rome, he
chose out a thousand young men to be knights, and <i>furno nominati
militi porche mille furono fatti in un tempo cavalleri</i>.—P.
1. C. 14. ff. 40.</p>

<p>The custom which some kings had of knighting themselves
is censured by the Partidas.—P. ii. T. 21. L. 11. It is
there said, that there must be one to give, and another to
receive the order. And a knight can no more knight, than a
priest can ordain himself.</p>

<p>“When the Infante Hernando of Castile was chosen king
of Aragon, he knighted himself on his coronation day:—<i>De
que tots los Barons nobles ho tengeren una gran maravella
com el matex se feu cavaller, qui segons los dessus dits deyen
nenguno pot esser cavaller, sino dones nos fa cavaller de ma de
cavaller qui hage lorde de cavalleria</i>.”—Tomich. C. 47. ff. 68.</p>

<p>“The qualifications for a knight, cavallero, or horse-soldier,
in the barbarous stage of society, were three: <i>1st</i>, That he
should be able to endure fatigue, hardship, and privations.
<i>2dly</i>, That he should have been used to strike, that his blows
might be the more deadly. <i>3dly</i>, That he should be bloody-minded,
and rob, hack, and destroy the enemy without compunction.
The persons, therefore, who were preferred, were
mountaineers, accustomed to hunting,—carpenters, blacksmiths,
stone-cutters, and butchers. But it being found that
such persons would sometimes run away, it was then discovered
that they who were chosen for cavaliers ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
a natural sense of shame. And for this reason it was appointed
that they should be men of family.”—<i>Partida, ii.
T. 21. L. 2. Vegetius, l. 1. c. 7.</i></p>

<p>The privileges of knighthood were at one time so great, that
if the goods of a knight were liable to seizure, they could not
be seized where he or his wife were present, nor even where
his cloak or shield was to be found.—<i>Part. ii. Tit. 21.
Ley 23.</i></p>

<p>Canciani (T. 3. p. 34.) gives a representation of Roland
from the porch of the Cathedral at Verona, which is supposed
to have been built about the beginning of the ninth century.
The figure is identified by the inscription on the sword, ...
<i>Du-rin-dar-da</i>. The <i>lorica</i>, which Canciani explains, <i>Vestica
bellica maculis ferreis contexta</i>, is illustrated by this figure. It
is a coat or frock of <i>scale</i>-mail reaching to the knees, and with
half sleeves. The only hand which appears is unarmed, as
far as the elbow. The right leg also is unarmed, the other
leg and foot are in the same sort of armour as the coat. The
end of a loose garment appears under the mail. The shield
reaches from the chin to the middle of the leg, it is broad
enough at the top to cover the breast and shoulder, and slopes
gradually off to the form of a long oval.</p>

<p>Fuller, the Worthy, has a beautiful passage in his Church
History concerning “Primitive Monks with their Piety and
Painfulness.”—“When the furnace of persecution in the infancy
of christianity was grown so hot, that most cities, towns,
and populous places were visited with that epidemical disease,
many pious men fled into deserts, there to live with more safety,
and serve God with less disturbance. No wild humour to make
themselves miserable, and to choose and court their own calamity,
put them on this project, much less any superstitious
opinion of transcendant sanctity in a solitary life, made them
willingly to leave their former habitations. For whereas all
men by their birth are indebted to their country, there to stay
and discharge all civil relations, it had been dishonesty in
them like bankrupts to run away into the wilderness to defraud
their country, their creditor, except some violent occasion (such
as persecution was) forced them thereunto; and this was the
first original of monks in the world, so called from μόνος, because
living alone by themselves.</p>

<p>“Here they in the deserts hoped to find rocks and stocks,
yea beasts themselves, more kind than men had been to them.
What would hide and heat, cover and keep warm, served them
for clothes, not placing (as their successors in after ages) any
holiness in their habit, folded up in the affected fashion thereof.
As for their food, the grass was their cloth, the ground their
table, herbs and roots their diet, wild fruits and berries their
dainties, hunger their sauce, their nails their knives, their hands
their cups, the next well their wine-cellar; but what their bill
of fare wanted in cheer it had in grace, their life being constantly
spent in prayer, reading, musing, and such like pious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
employments. They turned solitariness itself into society; and
cleaving themselves asunder by the divine art of meditation, did
make of one, two or more, opposing, answering, moderating in
their own bosoms, and busy in themselves with variety of
heavenly recreations. It would do one good even but to think
of their goodness, and at the rebound and second hand to meditate
upon their meditations. For if ever poverty was to be
envied it was here. And I appeal to the moderate men of these
times, whether in the height of these woeful wars, they have
not sometimes wisht (not out of passionate distemper, but serious
recollection of themselves) some such private place to retire
unto, where, out of the noise of this clamorous world, they
might have reposed themselves, and served God with more
quiet.”</p>

<p>“<i>Je ne serois pas en grande peine</i>,” says Pierre de Marca,
“<i>de rechercher les noms des Evesques des Bearn, si la saincte et
louable pratique des anciens Peres d’inserer dans les Diptyches, et
cayers sacrés de chascune Eglise, les noms des Evesques orthodoxes,
et qui estoient decedés dans la communion de l’Eglise Catholique,
eust este continuée jusqu’aux derniers siècles. Et je pourrois me
servir en cette rencontre du moyen que l’Empereur Justinian et
le cinquiesme Concile General employerent, pour sçavoir si
Theodore Evesque de Mopsuestie estoit reconnu apres sa mort
pour Evesque de l’Eglise qu’il avoit possedée durant sa vie. Car
ils ordonnerent a l’Evesque et au Clergé de cette ville, de revoir
les Diptyches de leur Eglise, et de rapporter fidellement ce qu’ils
y trouveroient. Ce qu’ayant exécuté diligemment, ils firent rapport
qu’apres avoir fueilleté quatre divers cayers en parchemin,
qui estoient leurs Diptyches, ils y avoient trouvé le nom de tous
les Evesques de ce siege; horsmis qu’en la place de Theodore,
avoit esté substitué le nom de Cyrille, qui estoit le Patriarche d’Alexandrie;
lequel présidant au Concile d’Ephese avoit condamné
l’heresie de Nestorius et de Theodore de Mopsuestie. D’ou
il apert que les noms de tous les Evesques depuis l’origine et l’establissement
de chascune des Eglises estoient enregistrés dans les
cayers que l’on appelloit Diptyches, et que l’on les recitoit nom par
nom en leur lieu, pendant la celebration de la Liturgie, tant pour
tesmoigner la continuation de la communion avec les Evesques
decedés, que l’on avoit euë avec euxmesmes vivans, qu’afin de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
procurer par les prieres publiques, et par l’efficace du Sacrifice non
sanglant, en la celebration du quel ils estoient recommendés a Dieu,
suivant l’ordonnance des Apostres, un grand profit, soulagement, et
refraichissement pour leurs ames, comme enseignent Cyrille de
Hierusalem, Chrysostome, et Epiphane.</i>”—Histoire de Bearn,
l. 4. c. 9. § 1.</p>

<p>“Some time before they made oblation for the dead, it was
usual in some ages to recite the names of such eminent bishops,
or saints, or martyrs, as were particularly to be mentioned in
this part of the service. To this purpose they had certain
books, which they called their Holy Books, and commonly their
<i>Diptychs</i>, from their being folded together, wherein the names
of such persons were written, that the deacon might rehearse
them as occasion required in the time of divine service. Cardinal
Bona and Schelstrate make three sorts of these <i>Diptychs</i>;
one wherein the names of bishops only were written, and more
particularly such bishops as had been governors of that particular
church: a second, wherein the names of the living were
written, who were eminent and conspicuous either for any
office and dignity, or some benefaction and good work, whereby
they had deserved well of the church; in this rank were the
patriarchs and bishops of great sees, and the bishop and clergy
of that particular church: together with the emperors and
magistrates, and others most conspicuous among the people;
the third was the book containing the names of such as were
deceased in catholic communion.—These therefore were of use,
partly to preserve the memory of such eminent men as were
dead in the communion of the church, and partly to make
honourable mention of such general councils as had established
the chief articles of the faith: and to erase the names either of
men or councils out of these <i>Diptychs</i>, was the same thing as
to declare that they were heterodox, and such as they thought
unworthy to hold communion with, as criminals, or some way
deviating from the faith. Upon this account St. Cyprian ordered
the name of Geminius Victor to be left out among those
that were commemorated at the holy table, because he had
broken the rules of the church. And Evagrius observes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
Theodorus bishop of Mopsuestia, that his name was struck out
of the Holy Books, that is, the <i>Diptychs</i>, upon the account of
his heretical opinions, after death. And St. Austin, speaking
of Cæcilian, Bishop of Carthage, whom the Donatists falsely
accused of being ordained by <i>Traditores</i>, or men who had delivered
up the Bible to be burned in the times of persecution,
tells them that if they could make good any real charge against
him, they would no longer name him among the rest of the
bishops, whom they believed to be faithful and innocent, at the
altar.”—<i>Bingham</i>, b. 15. ch. 3. sect. 17.</p>

<p>“The Council of Laodicea has two canons concerning the
little habit called the <i>Orarium</i>, which was a scarf or tippet to
be worn upon the shoulders; and might be used by bishops,
presbyters, and deacons, but not by subdeacons, singers, or
readers, who are expressly debarred the use of it in that council.—The
first council of Braga speaks of the <i>tunica</i> and the <i>orarium</i>
as both belonging to deacons. And the third council of
Braga orders priests to wear the <i>orarium</i> on both shoulders
when they ministered at the altar. By which we learn that
the <i>tunica</i> or <i>surplice</i> was common to all the clergy, the <i>orarium</i>
on the left shoulder proper to deacons, and on both shoulders
the distinguishing badge of priests.—The fourth council of
Toledo is most particular in these distinctions. For in one
canon it says, that if a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, be unjustly
degraded, and be found innocent by a synod, yet they
shall not be what they were before, unless they receive the degrees
they had lost from the hands of the bishops before the
altar. If he be a bishop, he must receive his <i>orarium</i>, his ring,
and his staff: if a presbyter, his <i>orarium</i> and <i>planeta</i>: if a
deacon, his <i>orarium</i> and <i>alba</i>. And in another canon, that the
deacon shall wear but one <i>orarium</i>, and that upon his left
shoulder, wherewith he is to give the signal of prayers to the
people. Where we may observe also the reason of the name
<i>orarium</i> in the ecclesiastical sense <i>ab orando</i>, from praying,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
though in common acceptation it signifies no more than an
handkerchief to wipe the face, and so comes <i>ab ore</i>, in which
signification it is sometimes used by St. Ambrose and St. Austin,
as well as by the old Roman authors. But here we take it in
the ecclesiastical sense for a sacred habit appropriated to bishops,
priests, and deacons, in the solemnities of divine service, in
which sense it appears to have been a habit distinct from that
of civil and common use, by all the authorities that have been
mentioned.”—<i>Bingham</i>, b. 13. c. 8. sect. 2.</p>

it is made of lamb’s wooll and superstition. I say of lamb’s wooll,
as it comes from the sheep’s back, without any other artificiall
colour, spun, say some, by a peculiar order of nunnes, first cast
into the tombe of St. Peter, taken from his body, say others,
surely most sacred if from both; and superstitiously adorned
with little black crosses. For the form thereof; the breadth
exceeded not three fingers, one of our bachelours’ lambskin
hoods in Cambridge would make three of them, having two
labells hanging down before and behind, which the archbishops
onely, when going to the altar, put about their necks, above
their other pontificall ornaments. Three mysteries were
couched therein. <i>First</i>, Humility, which beautifies the clergy
above all their costly copes. <i>Secondly</i>, Innocency, to imitate
lamb-like simplicitie. And, <i>Thirdly</i>, Industry, to follow him
who fetched his wandering sheep home on his shoulders. But
to speak plainly, the mystery of mysteries in the pall was, that
the archbishops receiving it shewed therein their dependence
on Rome; and a mote in this manner ceremoniously taken
was a sufficient acknowledgement of their subjection. And
as it owned Rome’s power, so in after ages it increased their
profit. For, though now such palls were freely given to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
archbishops, whose places in Britain for the present were
rather cumbersome than commodious, having little more than
their paines for their labour; yet in after ages the archbishop
of Canterburie’s pall was sold for five thousand florenes, so that
the pope might well have the golden fleece if he could sell all
his lamb’s wooll at that rate. Onely let me add, that the
author of Canterbury-book stiles this pall <i>Tanquam grande
Christi Sacramentum</i>. It is well <i>tanquam</i> came in to help it,
or else we should have had eight sacraments.”—<i>Fuller’s
Church History</i>, page 71.</p>

<p>“Among those,” says Morales, “who then passed from Toledo
to Asturias, was the archbishop of Toledo, named Urban.—He,
with a holy foresight, collected the sacred relics which he
could, and the most precious books of his own church and of
others, determining to carry them all to the Asturias, in order
that the holy relics might not be profaned or treated with
little reverence by the infidels; and that the books of the Holy
Scriptures, and of the ecclesiastical offices, and the works of our
holy doctors, might not be lost.—And although many relics
are mentioned which the archbishop then carried from Toledo,
especial mention is made of a holy ark full of many and most
remarkable relics, which through divers chances and dangers,
had been brought from Jerusalem to Toledo, and of which all
that is fitting shall be related in its place, if it please God that
this history should proceed. It is also expressly said, that the
cope which Our Lady gave to St. Ildefonso, was then carried
to the Asturias with the other relics; and being so capital a
relic, it was a worthy thing to write of it thus particularly. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
the sacred books which were saved at that time, there are
specified the Holy Scriptures, the Councils, the works of
St. Isidore, and St. Ildefonso, and of St. Julian the archbishop
of Toledo. And as there is at this day in the church of
Oviedo that holy ark, together with many others of the relics
which were then removed, so do I verily believe that there are
in the library of that church three or four books of those which
were then brought from Toledo. I am led to this belief by
seeing that they are written in a form of Gothic letters, which
being compared with writings six hundred years old, are without
doubt much older, and of characters so different, that they
may well be attributed to the times of the Goths. One is the
volume of the Councils, another is a <i>Santoral</i>, another contains
the books of St. Isidore <i>de Naturis Rerum</i>, with other works
of other authors. And there are also some leaves of a Bible.—To
put these sacred relics in greater security, and avoid the
danger of the Moors, they hid them in a cave, and in a sort of
deep pit therein, two leagues from the city of Oviedo, (which
was not at that time built,) in a mountain, which was for this
reason called Montesacro. It is now by a slight corruption
called Monsagro; and the people of that country hold the cave
in great veneration, and a great romery, or pilgrimage, is made
on St. Magdalen’s day.”—<i>Morales</i>, l. 12. c. 71.</p>

<p>The place where the relics were deposited is curiously
described in the Romantic Chronicle. “He found that in
this land of Asturias there was a sierra, full great, and high,
the which had only two entrances, after this manner. On the
one entrance there was a great river, which was to be passed
seven times, and in none of those seven places was it fordable
at any time, except in the month of July. And after the river
had been crost seven times, there was an ascent of a long
league up a high mountain, which is full of many great trees
and great thickets, wherein are many wild beasts, such as bears
and boars and wolves, and there is a pass there between two
rocks, which ten men might defend against the whole world,
and this is the one entrance. The other is, that you must
ascend this great mountain, by a path of two full leagues in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
length, on the one side having always the river, and the way
so narrow, that one man must go before another, and one man
can defend the path in such manner, that no arbalist, nor engine
of other kind, nor any other thing, can hurt him, not if the
whole world were to come against him. And if any one were
to stumble upon this path, he would fall more than two
thousand fathoms, down over rocks into the river, which lies at
such a depth that the water appears blacker than pitch. And
upon that mountain there is a good spring, and a plain where
there are good meadows, and room enough to raise grain for
eight or ten persons for a year; and the snow is always there
for company, enduring from one year to another. And upon
that mountain the archbishop made two churches, one to the
honour of St. Mary Magdalen, and the other to the honour
of St. Michael, and there he placed all these reliques, where
he had no fear that any should take them; and for the honour
of these relics, the archbishop consecrated the whole mountain,
and appointed good guard over the sacred relics, and left there
three men of good life, who were willing to remain there,
serving God, and doing penance for their sins.”—P. 2.
c. 48.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Camara Santa</i>, Morales has given a curious account
in his Journal; the substance, with other remarkable circumstances,
he afterwards thus inserted in his great history:—</p>

<p>“The other church (or chapel) which King Alonso el Casto
ordered to be built on the south side of the Iglesia Mayor (or
cathedral), was with the advocation of the Glorious Archangel
St. Michael. And in order that he might elevate it,
he placed under it another church of the Virgin and Martyr
St. Leocadia, somewhat low, and vaulted with a strong arch,
to support the great weight which was to be laid upon it.
The king’s motive for thus elevating this church of St. Michael,
I believe certainly to have been because of the great
humidity of that land. He had determined to place in this
church the famous relics of which we shall presently speak,
and the humidity of the region is so great, that even in
summer the furniture of the houses on high ground is covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
with mold. This religious prince therefore elevated the
church with becoming foresight for reverence and better
preservation of the precious treasure which was therein to
be deposited. For this reason they call it Camara, (the
chamber,) and for the many and great relics which it contains,
it has most deservedly the appellation of Holy. You
ascend to it by a flight of twenty-two steps, which begin in
the cross of the Iglesia Mayor (or cathedral), and lead to a
vaulted apartment twenty feet square, where there is an altar
upon which mass is said; for within there is no altar, neither
is mass said there by reason of the reverence shewn to so great
a sanctuary; and it may be seen that K. D. Alonso intended
in his plan that there should be no altar within. In this
apartment or outer chapel is a great arched door, with a very
strong fastening; it leads to another smaller square chamber,
vaulted also, with a square door, which also is fastened with
another strong fastening, and these are the fastenings and
keys which the Bishop Sampyro admires for their strength
and security.</p>

<p>“The square door is the door of the Holy Chamber, which
is in the form of a complete church, and you descend to it by
twelve steps. The body of this church is twenty-four feet in
length, and sixteen in width. Its arched roof is of the same
dimensions. The roof is most richly wrought, and supported
upon six columns of divers kinds of marble, all precious and
right beautiful, upon which the twelve apostles are sculptured,
two and two. The ground is laid with Mosaic work, with
variety of columns, representing jasper ware. The Bishop
Sampyro had good reason to complain of the darkness of this
church, which has only one small window in the upper part
of the chapel; and, therefore, in this which we call the body
of the church, there are commonly three silver lamps burning,
the one in the middle larger than the other two, and many
other lights are kindled when the relics are shewn. These
are kept within a grating, which divides the chapel from the
church. The chapel has two rich marbles at the entrance; it
is eighteen feet in length, and its width somewhat less; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
floor and the roof are after the same fashion as those of the
church, but it is one <i>estado</i> lower, which in those times seems
to have been customary in Asturias and in Gallicia, the
Capillas Mayores, or principal chapels, being much lower
than the body of the church. The roof of the chapel is plain,
and has painted in the middle our Saviour in the midst of the
four evangelists; and this performance is so ancient, that it
is manifestly of the age of the founder. At this iron grating
strangers are usually detained; there is a lower one within
of wood, to which persons are admitted who deserve this
privilege for their dignity; and few there be who enter
farther. This church the king built to remove to it, as
accordingly he forthwith removed, the Holy Ark, the holy
bodies, and the other great relics, which, at the destruction
of Spain, were hidden in the cave and well of Monsagro, and
for this cause he had it built with so much care, and so
richly, and with such security.——</p>

<p>“I have described the Camara Santa thus particularly, that
what I may say of the most precious relics which it contains
may be the better enjoyed. I will particularize the most
principal of them, beginning with the Holy Ark, which with
great reason has deserved this name. It is in the midst of
the chapel, close to the wooden grate, so that you can only
go round it on three sides, and it is placed upon a stone
pedestal, wrought with mouldings of a palm in height. It
is a vara and a half (about five feet) in length; little less than
a vara wide, and about as deep, that part which is of silver,
not including the height which the pedestal gives it. The
cover is flat, and it is covered in all parts with silver plates
of some thickness, and gilt on some places. In the front,
or that side which fronts the body of the church, it has the
twelve apostles in more than half relief, and on the sides
there are histories of Our Lady in the same silver-work. On
the flat part of the cover there is a large crucifix engraved
with many other images round about it. The sides are
elaborately wrought with foliage, and the whole displays great
antiquity. The cover has round about it four lines in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
silver, which, however, are imperfect, the silver being wanting
in some places. What they contain is this, as I have copied
it faithfully, with its bad Latin and other faults:—</p>

<p>“<i>Omnis conventus populi Deo dignus catholici cognoscat,

a large piece of the silver is gone.—<i>Novit omnis provintia in
terra sine dubio.</i>——Here there is another great chasm.—<i>Manus
et industria clericorum et præsulum, qui propter hoc convenimus

Christophori, Cucufati, Felicis, Sulpicii.</i></p>

<p>“This inscription, with its bad Latin and other defects,
and by reason of the parts that are lost, can ill be translated.
Nevertheless I shall render it, in order that it may be enjoyed
by all. It says thus: Know all the congregation of Catholic
people, worthy of God, whose the famous relics are, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
they venerate within the most precious sides of this ark. Know
then that herein is great part of the wood or cross of our Lord.
Of his garment for which they cast lots. Of the blessed bread
whereof he ate at the supper. Of his linen, of the holy handkerchief
(the Sudario), and of his most holy blood. Of the
holy ground which he then trod with his holy feet. Of the
garments of his mother the Virgin Mary, and also of her milk,
which is a great wonder. With these also there are many
capital relics of saints, whose names we shall write here as we
can. Saint Peter, St. Thomas, St. Bartholomew. Bones of
the prophets, and of all the Apostles, and of many other saints
whose names are known only to the wisdom of God. The noble
King Don Alonso, being full of humble devotion for all these
holy relics, made this repository, adorned and ennobled with
pledges of the saints, and on the outside covered with silver,
and gilded with no little cunning. For the which may he
deserve after this life the company of these Saints in heaven,
being aided by their intercession.—These holy relics were
placed here by the care and by the hands of many clergy and
prelates, who were here assembled with the said King D.
Alonso, and with his chosen sister called Donna Urraca. To
whom may the Redeemer of all grant remission and pardon
of their sins, for the reverence and rich reliquary which they
made for the said relics of the Apostles, and for those of the
Saints, St. Justus and Pastor, St. Cosme and St. Damian,
St. Eulalia the Virgin, and of the Saints Maximus, Germanus,
Baudilus, Pantaleon, Cyprianus and Justina, Sebastian, Facundus
and Primitivus, Christopher, Cucufatus, Felix and
Sulpicius.——</p>

<p>“The sum of the manner in which this Holy Ark came
into Spain is this, conformably to what is written by all our
grave authors. When Cosroes the King of Persia, in the time of
the Emperor Heraclius, came upon the Holy Land, and took
the city of Jerusalem, the bishop of that city, who was called
Philip, and his clergy, with pious forethought, secreted the
Holy Ark, which from the time of the Apostles had been kept
there, and its stores augmented with new relics, which were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
deposited therein. After the victory of Cosroes, the Bishop
Philip, with many of his clergy, passed into Africa, carrying
with them the Holy Ark: and there it remained some years,
till the Saracens entered into that province also, and then
Fulgentius the Bishop of Ruspina, with providence like that
which had made Philip bring it to Africa, removed it into
Spain. Thus it came to the Holy Church of Toledo, and
was from thence removed to Asturias, and hidden in the cave
of Monsagro: finally, King D. Alonso el Casto removed it to
the Camara Santa; and afterwards K. D. Alonso the Great
enriched it. Thus our histories write, and the same is read
in the lessons on the festival which the church of Oviedo
celebrates of the coming there of this Holy Ark, with a
sermon proper for the day, and much solemnity, the service
being said on the 13th of March after vespers, above in the
church of the Camara Santa. This is a most weighty testimony
which the Holy Ark possesses of its own authenticity,
and of the genuineness of the most great treasure which it
contains.—These also are strong testimonies, that K. D.
Alonso the Great should not only have made the Ark so rich,
but that this king should also have fortified the city of Oviedo,
surrounding it with walls, and making for it a castle, and
building also the castle of Gauzon upon the shore, for the
defence and security of this holy treasure, and for another end,
as he left written upon the stone of which we have elsewhere
spoken. Another testimony of great authority, is the great
reverence which has been shewn to this Holy Ark, from the
time which is spoken of by Alonso the Great in the inscription,
to these our days. This is so great that no one has dared to
open it, melancholy examples being related of some daring
attempts which have been made. That which occurred in our
days is not mournful, but rather of much devotion and holy
joy. The most illustrious Señor D. Christoval de Rojas y Sandoval,
who is now the most worthy Archbishop of Seville,
when he was Bishop of Oviedo, determined to open the Holy
Ark. For this, as the singular devotion and most holy zeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
for the glory of God which he has in all things, admonished
him, he made such pious preparations as the fame of so celestial
a treasure shewed to be necessary. He proclaimed solemnly a
fast of forty days in his church and through all his diocese,
commanding that prayers should be made to our Lord, beseeching
him that he would be pleased with what was intended, his
Most-Illustriousness giving the example, which is very common
and very edifying in his church, in himself, and in the ministers
thereof. Three days before the Sunday on which the Ark was
to be opened, he ordered all persons to fast, and to make greater
prayers with processions. When the day arrived, he said
pontifical mass, and preached, infusing with his holy exhortations
much of his own devout desires into the hearts of the
hearers. The mass being finished, clad as he was, he ascended
to the Camara Santa, with much outward solemnity, and with
much fervour of devotion internally in his heart; and having
there again renewed his humble prayers to our Lord, and
quickened the ardour of that sacred desire which had influenced
him; on his knees as he was before the Holy Ark, he took
the key to open it. At the moment when he stretched out his
hand to put the key in the lock, suddenly he felt such horror
and dismay, and found himself so bereft of all power (<i>tan
impossibilitado</i>) to move it in any way, that it was impossible
for him to proceed, or do any thing but remain in that holy
consternation, without having strength or ability for more.
And as if he had come there to oppose and prevent that which
purposely, and with so much desire and preparation, he had
intended to do, he desisted from his intent, and gave it up, his
whole holy desire being turned into a chill of humble shrinking
and fear. Among other things which his most Illustrious
Lordship relates of what he then felt, he says, that his hair
stood up in such a manner and with such force, that it seemed
to him, as if it lifted the mitre a considerable way from his
head. Now, we all know that this famous prelate has vigour
and persevering courage for all the great things which he
undertakes in the service of our Lord; but in this manner the
Holy Ark remained unopened then, and thus I believe it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
always remain fastened more surely with veneration and
reverence, and with respect of these examples, than with the
strong bolt of its lock.</p>

<p>“In the inscription of this Holy Ark, mention is made of
the relics of St. Baudilus, and by reason that he is a Saint
very little known, it will be proper to say something of him.
This Saint is much reverenced in Salamanca and in Zamora,
and in both cities he has a parochial church, and in Zamora
they have a good part of his relics. They have so much
corrupted the name, calling him St. Boal, that the Saint is
now scarcely known by his own.</p>

<p>“They of the church say, that the cope of St. Ildefonso,
which Our Lady gave him, is in the Ark. This may well be
believed, since our good authors particularly relate that it was
carried to Oviedo with the Holy Ark, and with the other
relics, and it does not now appear among them, and there is
much more reason to think that it has been very carefully put
away, than that it has been lost. Also they say, that when
the celestial cope was put into the Holy Ark, they took out
of it the piece of the holy Sudario, in which the head of our
Redeemer was wrapped up for his interment, as is said in the
inscription of the Ark. This is one of the most famous relics
in all Christendom, and therefore it is most richly adorned,
and reverently preserved, being shown only three times in the
year with the greatest solemnity. The box in which it is kept
is wrought without of gold and azure, with beautiful mouldings
and pictures, and other ornaments of much authority.
Within this there is a square piece of wood, covered entirely
with black velvet, with silver handles, and other decorations of
silver round about; in the hollow of this square, the holy
Sudario is stretched and fastened upon the velvet; it is a thin
linen cloth, three quarters long and half a vara wide, and in
many places full of the divine blood from the head of our
Redeemer, in divers forms and stains of various sizes;
wherein some persons observe marks of the divine countenance
and other particularities. I did not perceive this; but the
feeling which came upon me when I looked at it is sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
to make me believe any thing of it; and if a wretch like me
was thus affected, what must it be with those who deserve
of our Lord greater regalements on such an occasion? It is
exhibited to the people three times in the year; on Good Friday,
and on the two festivals of the Cross in May and in September,
and there is then a great concourse from all the country,
and from distant parts. This part of the cross of the
church where the Camara Santa is, is richly hung, and in the
first apartment of the Camara, a corridor is erected for this
exhibition, which is closed that day with curtains of black
velvet, and a canopy that extends over the varandas. The
Bishop in his pontificals, with his assistants and other grave
persons, places himself behind the curtains with the Holy
Sudario, holding it by the silver handles, covered with a veil.
The curtains are undrawn, and the quiristers below immediately
begin the <i>Miserere</i>. The Bishop lifts the veil, and at
the sight of the Holy Sudario, another music begins of the
voices of the people, deeply affected with devotion, which
verily penetrates all hearts. The Bishop stands some time,
turning the Sacred Relic to all sides, and afterwards the veil
being replaced, and the curtains redrawn, he replaces the
Holy Sudario in its box. With all these solemnities, the very
Illustrious and most Reverend Señor, M. D. Gonzalo de
Solorzano, Bishop of Oviedo, exhibited this Holy Relic on
the day of Santiago, in the year of our Redeemer 1572, in
order that I might bear a more complete relation of the whole
to the King our Lord, I having at that time undertaken this
sacred journey by his command.</p>

<p>“Another chest, with a covering of crimson and brocade,
contains a good quantity of bones, and some pieces of a head;
which, although they are very damp, have a most sweet odour,
and this all we who were present perceived, when they were
shown me, and we spoke of it as of a notable and marvellous
thing. The account which they of the church give of this
holy body is, that it is that of St. Serrano, without knowing
any thing more of it. I, considering the great dampness of
the sacred bones believe certainly that it was brought up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
the Camara Santa from the church of Leocadia, which, as it
has been seen, is underneath it. And there, in the altar, the
great stone-chest is empty, in which King Alonso el Casto
enclosed many relics, as the Bishop Sampyro writes. For
myself I have always held for certain, that the body of St.
Leocadia is that which is in this rich chest. And in this
opinion I am the more confirmed since the year 1580, when
such exquisite diligence has been used by our Spaniards in
the monastery of St. Gisleno, near Mons de Henao in
Flanders, to verify whether the body of St. Leocadia, which
they have there, is that of our Saint. The result has been,
that it was ascertained beyond all doubt to be the same; since
an authentic writing was found of the person who carried it
thither by favour of one of our earliest kings, and he carried
it from Oviedo without dispute; because, according to my
researches, it is certain that it was there. Now I affirm, that
the king who gave part left part also; and neither is that
which is there so much, that what we saw at Oviedo might
not well have been left, neither is this so much but that which
is at Mons might well have been given.</p>

<p>“In the church below, in a hollow made for this purpose,
with grates, and a gate well ornamented, is one of the vessels
which our Redeemer Jesus Christ filled with miraculous wine
at the marriage in Galilee. It is of white marble, of an
ancient fashion, more than three feet high, and two wide at
the mouth, and contains more than six <i>arrobas</i>. And forasmuch
as it is in the wall of the church of K. Alonso el Casto,
and all the work about it is very ancient, it may be believed
that the said king ordered it to be placed there.”—<i>Coronica
General de Espana</i>, l. 13. b. 40.</p>

<p>Morales gives an outline of this vessel in his Journal, and
observes, that if the Christians transported it by land, particular
strength and the aid of God would have been necessary
to carry it so many leagues, and move it over the rugged
mountains of Europa;—but, he adds, it might have come by
water from Andalusia or Portugal, and in that case this would
have been a land journey of only four or five leagues.—In his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
Journal, Morales mentions certain other relics of which the
church of Oviedo boasted, but for which he required better
evidence than could be adduced for them. Such were a portion
of Tobit’s fish, and of Sampson’s honey-comb, with other
such things, which, he says, would lessen the credit of the
Ark, where, according to the Bishop of Oviedo, D. Pelayo,
and Sebastian, Bishop of Salamanca, they were deposited.
Of these precious relics he says nothing in his history, neither
does he mention a piece of Moses’s rod, a large piece of St.
Bartholomew’s skin, and the sole of St. Peter’s shoe, all which
he enumerates in his Journal, implying rather than expressing
his doubts of their authenticity. As a scrupulous and faithful
antiquary, Morales was accustomed to require evidence, and
to investigate it; and for these he could find no other testimony
than tradition and antiquity, which, as presumptive
proofs, were strong corroborants of faith, but did not suffice of
themselves. The Holy Ark has all the evidence which he
required, and the reverence with which he regarded it, is
curiously expressed in his Journal. “I have now,” he says,
“described the material part of the Camara Santa. The
spiritual and devout character which it derives from the sacred
treasures which it contains, and the feeling which is experienced
upon entering it, cannot be described without giving
infinite thanks to our Lord, that he has been pleased to suffer
a wretch like me to enjoy it. I write this in the church
before the grating, and God knows I am as it were beside
myself with fear and reverence, and I can only beseech God
to give me strength to proceed with that for which I have no
power myself.”—T. 10. <i>Viage</i>, p. 91.</p>

<p>Morales, like Origen, had given in his youth a decisive
proof of the sincerity of his religious feelings, and it sometimes
seems as if he had emasculated his mind as well as
his body. But with all this abject superstition, he was a
thoroughly pious and good man. His life is deeply interesting,
and his writings, besides their great historical and antiquarian
value, derive additional interest from the picture of
the author’s mind which they so frequently display. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
portrait prefixed to the last edition of his work is singularly
characteristic.</p>

<p>As late as the age of the Philips, the Portugueze were
called Sevosos by the Castillians, as an opprobrious name.
Brito says, It was the old word Suevos continued and corrupted,
and used contemptuously, because its origin was forgotten.—<i>Monarchia
Lusitana</i>, 2. 6. 4.</p>

<p>When the Sueves and Alans over-ran Spain they laid siege
to Lisbon, and the Saints Maxima, Julia, and Verissimus (a
most undoubted personage) being Lisbonians, were applied to
by their town’s people to deliver them. Accordingly, a sickness
broke out in the besieger’s camp, and they agreed to
depart upon payment of a sum of money. Bernardo de Brito
complains that Blondus and Sabellicus, in their account of this
transaction, have been so careless as to mention the money
and omit the invocation of the Saints.—<i>M. Lus.</i> 2. 5. 23.</p>

In the plains of Akkermute and Jibbel Hidded in

<p>Among the <i>Prerogatives et Propriétés singulières du Prophète</i>,
Gagnier states that, “<i>Il est vivant dans son Tombeau. Il
fait la prière dans ce Tombeau à chaque fois que le Crieur en
fait la proclamation, et au même tems qu’on la recite. Il y a un
Ange posté sur son Tombeau qui a le soin de lui donner avis des
Pri res que les Fidèles font pour lui.</i>”—Vie de Mahomet, l.
vii. c. 18.</p>

<p>The common notion that the impostor’s tomb is suspended
by means of a loadstone is well known. Labat, in his Afrique
Occidentale (T. ii. p. 143.) mentions the lie of a Marabout,
who, on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina,
affirmed, “<i>que le tombeau de Mahomet etoit porté en l’air par le
moyen de certains Anges qui se relayent d’heure en heures pour
soutenir ce fardeau</i>.” These fables, however, are modest in
comparison with those which the Franciscans and Dominicans

<p>The battle of Covadonga is one of the great miracles of
Spanish history. It was asserted for many centuries without
contradiction, and is still believed by the people, that when the
Moors attacked Pelayo in the cave, their weapons were turned
back upon themselves; that the Virgin Mary appeared in the
clouds, and that part of a mountain fell upon the Infidels, and
crushed those who were flying from the destruction. In what

tan gran calor, como el sol en medio del dia quando va mas

a España a predicar a los gentiles la ceguedad en que
estavan, e que los alumbrarie con la fee de Jesu Chrysto, e aquesto

General, ff. 71.</p>

<p>A more extraordinary example of the divine favour towards
Spain is triumphantly brought forward by Francisco de Pisa.
“Our Lord God,” says he, “has been pleased to preserve these
kingdoms in the purity of the Faith, like a terrestrial Paradise,
by means of the Cherubim of the Holy Office, which with its
sword of fire has defended the entrance, through the merits
and patronage of the most serene Virgin Mary the Mother of
God.” “<i>Ha sido servido nuestro Señor Dios conservar estos
reynos de España en la entereza de la Fe, como a un Parayso
terrenal, mediante el Cherubin del Santo Officio, que con su
espada de fuego les ha defendido la entrada por los meritos y

that it fell from Heaven. Morales however says, it is more
certain that the king had it made to go out with it to battle at
Covadonga. It was covered with gold and enamel in the year
908; when Morales wrote, it was in fine preservation, and
doubtless so continued till the present generation. Upon the
top branch of the cross there was this inscription: <i>Susceptum
placide maneat hoc in honore Dei, quod offerunt famuli Christi
Adefonsus Princeps et Scemena Regina.</i> On the right arm,
<i>Quisquis auferre hæc donaria nostra presumpserit, fulmine divino
intereat ipse.</i> On the left, <i>Hoc opus perfectum est, concessum
est Sancto Salvatori Ovetensis Sedis. Hoc signo tuetur pius,
hoc signo vincitur inimicus.</i> On the foot, <i>Et operatum est in
Castello Gauzon anno Regni nostri XVII discurrente Era
DCCCCXLVI.</i></p>

<p>“There is no other testimony,” says Morales, “that this
is the cross of King Don Pelayo, than tradition handed down
from one age to another. I wish the king had stated that it
was so in his inscription, and I even think he would not have
been silent upon this point, unless he had wished to imitate
Alonso el Casto, who, in like manner, says nothing concerning
the Angels upon his cross.” This passage is very characteristic
of good old Ambrosio.</p>

<p>The account which the Romantic Chronicle gives of Roderick
after his disappearance, is in so singular a strain of fiction,
that I have been tempted to translate it. It strikingly exemplifies
the doctrine of penance, of which monastic history
supplies many instances almost as extraordinary as this fable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span></p>

<p class="heading">Chap. 238.—<i>How the King Don Rodrigo left the battle and
arrived at a hermitage, and of that which befell him.</i></p>

<p>“Now when the King Don Rodrigo had escaped from the
battle, he began to go as fast as he could upon his horse along
the banks of the Guadalete, and night came on, and the horse
began to fail by reason of the many wounds which he had
received; and as he went thus by the river side deploring the
great ruin which had come upon him, he knew not where he
was, and the horse got into a quagmire, and when he was in
he could not get out. And when the king saw this he alighted,
and stript off all his rich arms and the furniture thereof, and
took off his crown from his head, and threw them all into the
quagmire, saying, Of earth was I made, and even so are all my
deeds like unto mud and mire. Therefore my pomp and
vanity shall be buried in this mud till it has all returned
again to earth, as I myself must do. And the vile end which
I have deserved will beseem me well, seeing that I have been
the principal cause of this great cruelty. And as he thus
stript off all his rich apparel, he cast the shoes from his feet,
and went his way, and wandered on towards Portugal; and
he travelled so far that night and the day following, that he
came to a hermitage near the sea, where there was a good man
who had dwelt there serving God for full forty years; and
now he was of great age, for he was well nigh a hundred years
old. And he entered into the hermitage, and found a crucifix
therein, being the image of our Lord Jesus Christ, even as he
was crucified, and for the remembrance of Him, he bent both
his knees to the ground, and claspt his hands, weeping and
confessing his sins before God, for he weened not that any man
in the world saw or heard him. And he said thus, O very
Lord who by thy word hast made all the world from nothing
which it was, and hast created all things, those which are
visible to men, and those which are invisible, the heavenly as
well as the earthly, and who didst incarnate thyself that thou
mightest undergo thy passion and death, to save those who
firmly put their trust in thee, giving up thy holy ghost from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
thy glorified body upon the tree of the true cross,—and who
didst descend into Hell, and deliveredst thy friends from
thence, and didst regale them with the glory of Heaven; And
afterwards thy holy spirit came again into that most holy body,
which thou wast pleased to take upon thee in this world; and,
manifesting thyself for the true God which thou wert, thou
didst deign to abide in this dark world forty days with their
nights, and then thou didst ascend into thy heavenly glory,
and didst enlighten with the grace of the Holy Ghost thy
beloved disciples. I beseech thee, O Lord, that thou wouldst
enlighten me, a king in tribulation, wretched and full of many
sins, and deserving all evils; let not the soul which is thine,
and which cost thee so dear, receive the evil and the desert of
this abominable flesh; and may it please thee, O Lord, after
the downfall, destruction, perdition, and desolation, which I, a
miserable king, have suffered in this world, that my disconsolate
soul may not be forgotten by thee, and that all this misery
may be in satisfaction for my errors. And I earnestly beseech
thee, O Lord, that thy grace may breathe upon me, that in
this world I may make satisfaction for my sins, so that at the
Great Day of Judgement I may not be condemned to the torments
of hell.</p>

<p>“Having said these words, weeping as though he would
burst, he remained there a long hour. And when the Hermit
heard him say all this, he was greatly astonished, and he went
unto him. And when the King saw him he was little pleased;
howbeit after he had talked with him, he would rather have
found him there than have been restored again to the great
honour which he had lost; for the Hermit comforted him in
such wise in this his tribulation, that he was right well contented;
and he confessed unto him, and told him all that concerned
him. And the Hermit said to him, King, thou shalt remain
in this hermitage, which is a remote place, and where thou
mayest lead thy life as long as it shall please God. And for
me, on the third day from hence, I shall pass away out of this
world; and thou shalt bury me, and thou shalt take my
garments, and fulfil the time of a year in this hermitage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
Take no thought as to provision for thy support, for every
Friday thou shalt have it after the same manner as I, and thou
shalt so husband it, that it may suffice thee for the whole week;
That flesh which hath been fostered in great delight shall
suffer abstinence, lest it should grow proud; and thou shalt
endure hunger and cold and thirst in the love of our Lord,
that he may have compassion upon thee. Thy station till
the hour of sleep must always be upon that rock, where there is
an oratory facing the east; and thou shalt continue the service
of God in such manner as God will direct thee to do. And
take heed that thy soul fall not into temptation. And since
thou hast spoken this day of penitence, to-morrow thou shalt
communicate and receive the true body of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who will be thy protection and support against the
enemy and the persecutor. And put thou thy firm trust in
the sign of the Cross; and thus shalt thou please thy
Saviour.</p>

<p>“Many other things the holy Hermit said, which made the
King right joyful to hear them; and there they continued till
it was the hour for sleep. And the holy Hermit shewed him
his bed, and said, When I shall have left the company, thou
wilt follow the ways which I have followed, for which our
Lord will have mercy upon thee, and will extend his hand
over thee, that thou mayest persevere in good, and in his holy
service. And then they laid down and slept till it was the
hour of matins, when they should both arise. And the Hermit
awoke him, for as the King had not slept for a long time, and
was moreover full weary, he would not have awaked so soon,
if the Hermit had not roused him; and they said their hours.
And when it was time the Hermit said mass, and the King
heard it with great devotion, and communicated with great
contrition, and remained in prayer for the space of two hours.
And the hour for taking food came, and the Hermit took a
loaf which was made of pannick and of rye, and gave half
thereof to the King, and took for himself the other half: And
they ate little of it, as men who could not eat more, the one by
reason of age, and the other because he was not used to such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
fare. And thus they continued till the third day, when the
holy Hermit departed this life.”</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 239.—<i>How the Hermit died, and the King found a writing
in his hand.</i></p>

<p>“On the third day, the pious Hermit expired at the same
hour which he had said to the King, whereat the King was
full sorrowful, as one who took great consolation in the lessons
which he gave. And when he had thus deceased, the King
by himself, with his hands, and with an oaken stick which was
there, made his grave. And when he was about to bury him,
he found a writing in his hand; and he took it and opened it,
and found that it contained these words.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 240.—<i>Of the rule of life which the Hermit left written for
King Don Rodrigo.</i></p>

<p>“O King, who through thy sins hast lost the great honour
in which thou wert placed, take heed that thy soul also come
not into the same judgement which hath fallen upon thy flesh.
And receive into thy heart the instructions that I shall give
thee now, and see that thou swerve not from them, nor abatest
them a jot; for if thou observest them not, or departest in
ought from them, thou wilt bring damnation upon thy soul;
for all that thou shalt find in this writing is given thee for
penance, and thou must learn with great contrition of repentance,
and with humbleness of patience, to be content with that
which God hath given thee to suffer in this world. And that
thou mayest not be deceived in case any company should come
unto thee, mark and observe this and pass in it thy life. Thou
shalt arise two hours after midnight, and say thy matins
within the hermitage. When the day breaks thou shalt go to
the oratory, and kneeling upon the ground, say the whole
hours by the breviary, and when thou hast finished them thou
shalt say certain prayers of our Lord, which thou wilt find
therein. And when thou hast done this, contemplate then upon
the great power of our Lord, and upon his mercy, and also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
upon the most holy passion which he suffered for mankind
upon the cross, being himself very God, and maker of all
things; and how with great humility he chose to be incarnate
in a poor virgin, and not to come as a king, but as a mediator
among the nations. And contemplate also upon the poor life
which he always led in this world, to give us an example; and
that he will come at the day of judgement to judge the quick
and the dead, and give to every one the meed which he hath
deserved. Then shalt thou give sustenance to thy flesh of
that bread of pannick and rye, which shall be brought to thee
every Friday in the manner that I have said; and of other
food thou shalt not eat, although it should be given or sent
thee; neither shalt thou change thy bread. And when thou
hast eaten give thanks to God, because he has let thee come to
repentance; and then thou shalt go to the oratory, and there
give praise to the Virgin our Lady holy Mary, mother of God,
in such manner as shall come to thee in devotion. If when,
thou hast finished, heaviness should come upon thee, thou
mayest sleep, and when thou shalt have rested as long as is
reasonable, return thou to thy oratory, and there remain,
making thy prayers always upon thy knees, and for nothing
which may befall thee depart thou from thence, till thou hast
made an end of thy prayers, whether it rain or snow, or if a
tempest should blow. And for as much as the flesh could
sustain so many mundane pleasures, so must it suffer also
celestial abstinences; two masses thou hast heard in this
hermitage, and in it, it is God’s will that thou shalt hear no
more, for more would not be to his service. And if thou
observest these things, God will have compassion upon thy
deserts. And when the King had read this, he laid it upon
the altar, in a place where it would be well preserved.”</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 241.—<i>How the Devil came in the form of a Hermit to
deceive the King Don Rodrigo.</i></p>

<p>“Now when the King had made a grave in which to bury
the Hermit, the Devil was troubled at the good course which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
the King had taken, and he cast about for means how he might
deceive him; and he found none so certain as to come to him
in the figure of a hermit, and keep company with him, to turn
him aside from those doctrines which the Hermit had given
him, that he might not fulfil his penitence. And the King
being in great haste to bury the body, the Devil came to him
with a long white beard, and a great hood over the eyes, and
some paternosters hanging from his girdle, and supporting
himself upon a staff as though he were lame, and could not go.
And when he came where the King was he humbled himself,
and said unto him, Peace be with thee! And the King turned
toward that side from which he came, and when he saw him
of so great age, he thought that it was some holy man who
knew of the death of the Hermit, and was come to bury him;
and he humbled himself, and went towards him to kiss his
hand, and the Devil would not, saying, It is not fitting that a
King should kiss the hand of a poor servant of God. And
the King was astonished at hearing himself named, and
believed that this must needs be a man of holy life, and that
he spake by some revelation; nevertheless he said, I am not a
king, but a miserable sinner, for whom it had been better never
to have been born, than that so much evil should have happened
through me. And the false Hermit said to him, Think
not that thou hast so much fault as thou imaginest in what
has now been done, for even if thou hadst had no part in it,
this destruction would have fallen at this time. And since it
was ordained that it should be so, the fault is not thine; some
fault thou hadst, but it was very little. And think not that I
speak this of myself; for my words are those of a spirit made
and created by the will of God, who speaks through me this
and many other things, which hereafter thou shalt know, that
thou mayest see how God has given me power that I should
know all thy concerns, and counsel thee in what manner thou
shouldst live. And albeit I have more need of rest than of
labour, by reason of my age, which is far greater than my
countenance shows, yet I have disposed myself to labour for
the love of thee, to console thee in this thy persecution, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
that this good man was about to die. Of a truth you may
believe that on this day month I was in Rome, being there in
the church of St. John de Lateran, out of which I had never
gone for thirty years, till I came now to keep thee company
according as I am commanded. Marvel not that a man of so
great age and crippled as I am, should have been able to
traverse so much land in so short time, for certes I tell thee
that he who speaks in this form which thou seest, has given
me strength to go through so great a journey; and sans doubt
I feel myself as strong now as on the day when I set forth.
And the King said to him, Friend of God, I rejoice much in
thy coming, for that in my misfortunes I shall be by thee
consoled and instructed in that which must be done to fulfil
my penitence; I rejoice also that this holy Hermit here shall
receive burial from the hands of a man much more righteous
than I. And the false Hermit said, Think not, King, that it
is for the service of God to give to any person a name not appertaining
to him. And this I say because I well know the life
of this person, what it was; and as thou knowest nothing of
celestials, thou thinkest that as the tongue speaketh, even such
is the heart. But I tell thee the habit doth not make the
monk, and it is from such persons as these that the saying
arose which is common in the world, I would have justice, but
not for my own house. This I say to thee, because he commanded
thee to perform a penance such as never man did, the
which is, that thou shouldst eat only once a day, and that of
such bread that even the shepherds’ dogs would not eat it;
and of this that thou shouldst not eat as much as thou couldst;
and appointed thee the term of a year that thou shouldst continue
in this diet. Also he commanded thee that thou shouldst
not hear mass during the time that thou abidest here, for that
the two masses which thou hast heard should suffice; look
now if that doctrine be good, which bids a man forget the holy
sacrament! Certes I tell thee that only for that which he commanded
thee to observe, his soul is consigned to a place where
I would not that thine should go for all the world, if it were
in my power, with all its riches. Nevertheless, to be rid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
the ill smell which he would give, it is fit that you should bury
him, and while you do this I will go for food. And the King
said, Friend of God, do not take this trouble, but remain still,
and before noon there will come food, which will suffice for
you and for me; help me now to give burial to this good man,
which will be much for the service of God, although he may
have been a sinner. And the false Hermit answered, King,
it would be less evil to roll him over these rocks into the sea;
but if not, let him lie thus upon the earth till the birds and the
beasts devour his flesh. And the King marvelled at this:
nevertheless though he believed that this false Hermit was a
servant of God, he left not for that to bury the good Hermit
who there lay without life, and he began by himself to carry
him to the grave which he had made. And as he was employed
in burying him, he saw that the false Hermit went
away over the mountains at a great rate, not as one who was
a cripple, but like a stout man and a young; and he marvelled
what this might mean.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 242.—<i>How King Don Rodrigo informed himself concerning
the penance which he was to perform, from the writing which
the holy Hermit left him.</i></p>

<p>“When the King had finished burying the good servant of
God, he went to the altar, and took the writing in his hand,
and read it to inform himself well of it. And when he had
read it, he saw that of a certainty all that was said therein was
for the service of God, and was of good doctrine for his soul;
and he said, that, according to the greatness of his sins, it
behoved that his penitence must be severe, if he wished to save
his soul. And then he called to mind the life which St. Mary
Magdalen endured, for which God had mercy on her. And
forthwith he went to his oratory, and began his prayers; and
he remained there till it was near noon; and he knew that he
had nothing to eat, and awaited till it should be brought
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 243.—<i>How the Devil brought meat to King Don Rodrigo
that he should eat it; and he would only eat of the Hermit’s
bread.</i></p>

<p>“After it was mid-day the false Hermit came with a
basket upon his shoulders, and went straight to where the
King was, and he came sweating and weary. And the King
had compassion on him, howbeit he said nothing, neither did
he leave his prayers. And the false Hermit said to him,
King, make an end of thy prayers, for it is time to eat; and
here I bring food. And the King lifted up his eyes and
looked toward him, and he saw that there came into the hermitage
a shepherd with a wallet upon his back, and he
thought this must be he who brought him that which he was
to eat. And so in truth it was, that that shepherd brought
every Friday four loaves of pannick and rye for the holy
Hermit, upon which he lived during the week. And as this
shepherd knew not that the good man was dead, he did no
more than put his bread upon the altar, and go his way.
And the King, when he had ceased praying, rose up from the
oratory, and went to the false Hermit. And he found the
four loaves, and he took one, and brake it in the middle, and
laid by the rest carefully, and he went out of the hermitage
into the portal, where there was a table full small, and he
laid a cloth upon it, and the bread which he was to eat, and
the water; and he began to bless the table, and then seated
himself. And the false Hermit noted well how he blest the
table, and arose from where he was, and went to the King,
and said, King take of this poor fare which I have brought,
and which has been given me in alms. And he took out two
loaves which were full white, and a roasted partridge, and a
fowl, of which the legs were wanting; and he placed it upon
the table. And when the King saw it, his eyes were filled
with tears, for he could not but call to mind his great honour
in former times, and how it was now fallen, and that his table
had never before been served like this. And he said, addressing
himself to the Lord, Praised be thy name, thou who canst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
make the high low, and the low nothing. And he turned to
his bread and did eat thereof. And though he had great
hunger, yet could he scarcely eat thereof, for he had never
used it till in that hermitage, and now it seemed worse by reason
of the white bread which that false Hermit had brought.
And the false Hermit, who saw that he gave no regard neither
to the bread, nor the meat which he had brought, said to the
King, Why eatest thou not of this which God has sent thee?
and the King said, I came not to this hermitage to serve God,
but to do penance for my sins, that my soul may not be lost.
And the penance which is given me in this life, I must observe
for a year and not depart from it, lest it should prove to my
great hurt. And the false Hermit said, How, King, hath it
been given thee for penance, that thou shouldst let thyself die
for despair? The Gospel commands not so; contrariwise
it forbids man to do any such penance through which the
body might be brought to death; for if in killing another,
he who causes the death is held for a murderer, much more is
he who killeth himself; and such thou wouldst be. And now
through despair thou wouldst let thyself die of hunger, that
thou mightest no longer live in this world, wherefore I say
eat of this food that I have brought thee some little, that thou
mayest not die. And with that he began to eat right heartily.
And the King, when he beheld him, was seized with affection
to do the like, howbeit he was withheld, and would eat nothing
thereof. And as it was time when he would drink of the
water, the false Hermit said to him, that he should drink of
the wine; and the King would only taste of that water; and
as he went to take of it, the false Hermit struggled with him,
but he could not prevail, and the King did according to his
rule, and departed not from it. And when he had eaten, he
began to give thanks to God. And the false Hermit, who
saw that he would have to cross himself at arising from the
table, rose up before him, as one who was about to do something;
and the King heeded it not. And when he had thus
eaten, he went to the oratory, and began to give praises to the
Virgin Mary, according as the good man had commanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
him; when that traitor went to him and said, Certes this doctrine
which thou holdest is no way to serve God, for sans
doubt when the stomach is heated with food the will shall
have no power to pray as it ought; and although the tongue
may say the prayers, the heart confirms them not, being hindered
by the force which nature derives from the food. Therefore
I say to thee that thou oughtest to sleep first; for whilst
thou art sleeping the food will settle, and the will will then be
more able for contemplation. Moreover, God is not pleased
with prayers without contrition, as with one who speaketh of
one thing, and hath his heart placed on another, so that he
can give no faith to the words which he beginneth. If thou
wouldest be saved, O King, it behoves thee to listen to me;
and if thou wilt not believe me, I will depart and leave thee,
as one who will take no counsel, except from himself. And
the King replied, if I should see that thou confirmedst the
good manner of life whereof my soul hath need, according as
it was appointed by the good man whom I have buried, then
would I follow thy way. But I see that thy life is not that of
a man of abstinence, nor of one who forsakes worldly enjoyments
for the love of God; rather it seemeth by what I see in
thee that thy life is a strengthening of worldly glory; for thou
satisfiest thy flesh with good viands as I was wont to do, when
I was puffed up with the vanities of the world. Wherefore I
will in no wise follow thy way, for I see that thou art a
worldly man, who deceivest God and the world, and when it
comes to the end thou thyself wilt be deceived.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 244.—<i>Of what the Devil said to King Don Rodrigo to
dispart him from his penance.</i></p>

<p>“The false Hermit said to him, For what reason art thou
certain that the rule which this deceiver whom thou hast
buried appointed for thee, will be salvation for thy soul, and
that what I say to thee is not of a truth? Thou understandest
me not well: I never forbade thee that thou shouldst hear
mass, as he has done; for this is one of the good things that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
man may every day see his Saviour and adore him. And
seeing that he forbade thee to do this, thou mayest be certain
that as he deceived his own soul, he would deceive thine also.
For at the hour when man passeth away out of the world, he
would fain that that same hour should be the end of all
the world; and thus that enemy did, for where he went, thither
he would draw thee also. Now since God hath given
thee sense and reason, thou mayest clearly understand that his
counsel and doctrine are deceitful, and what thou oughtest
to do.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 245.—<i>Of the Reply which the King made to the Devil.</i></p>

<p>“Sans doubt, said the King, he forbade me not that I
should hear mass; but because he commanded me that I
should fulfil my penance here for the term of a year, as he
knew the hour of his own death, so also he knew that no other
person who could say mass would come to this hermitage
within the year; and, therefore, he said to me, that in this
hermitage I should not hear mass, but he never forbade me
from hearing it.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 246.—<i>Of the Reasoning which the false Hermit made to
King Don Rodrigo.</i></p>

<p>“The false Hermit said, Now thou thyself manifestest that
he was not so worthy as a man ought to be who knows that
which is to come. For according to thy words, he knew not
that I should come here, who can say mass if I please; and if
there be good judgement in thee, thou wilt understand that I
must needs be nearer to God, because I know all which he
had commanded thee to do, and also how he was to die. And
I can know better in what place he is, than he who has commanded
thee to observe this rule, knew concerning himself
while he was here. But this I tell thee, that as I came to
teach thee the way in which thou shouldst live, and thou wilt
not follow my directions, I will return as I came. And now
I marvel not at any thing which has befallen thee, for thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
hast a right stubborn heart; hard and painful wilt thou find
the way of thy salvation, and in vain wilt thou do all this, for
it is a thing which profiteth nothing.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 247.—<i>Of the Reply which King Don Rodrigo made to
the false Hermit.</i></p>

<p>“Good man, said the King, all that thou shalt command
me to do beyond the rule which the holy Hermit appointed
me, that will I do; that in which my penance may be more
severe, willingly will I do it. But in other manner I will not
take thy counsel; and as thou hast talked enough of this,
leave me, therefore, to my prayers. And then the King bent
his knees, and began to go on with his rule. And the false
Hermit when he saw this, departed, and returned not again for
a month; and all that time the King maintained his penance,
in the manner which had been appointed him. And by reason
that he ate only of that black bread, and drank only water,
his flesh fell away, and he became such that there was not a
man in the world who would have known him. Thus he remained
in the hermitage, thinking of no other thing than to
implore the mercy of God that he would pardon him.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 248.—<i>Of what the false Hermit said to King Don Rodrigo
to dispart him from his rule.</i></p>

<p>“King Don Rodrigo living thus, one day, between midnight
and dawn, the false Hermit came to the hermitage; and
not in the same figure as before, but appearing more youthful,
so that he would not be known. And he called at the door,
and the King looked who it might be, and saw that he was
habited like a servant of God, and he opened the door forthwith.
And they saluted each other. And when they saw
each other, the false Hermit greeted the King, and demanded
of him where the father was; and the King answered, that
for more than a month there had been no person dwelling
there save himself. And the false Hermit, when he heard
this, made semblance as if he were afflicted with exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
grief, and said, How came this to be, for it is not yet six
weeks since I came here and confessed my sins to the father
who abode here, and then departed from this hermitage to my
own, which is a league from hence? And King Don Rodrigo
said, Friend, know that this Hermit is now in Paradise,
as I believe, and I buried him with my own hands: and he
showed him the place where he lay. And when he went
there he began to kiss the earth of the grave, and to make
great dole and lamentation over him. And when some half
hour had past, he withdrew, making semblance as if he wished
to say his hours. And before the King had finished to say
his, he came to him, and said, Good man, will you say mass?
And the King answered, that he never said it. Then, said
the false Hermit, Hear me then in penitence, for I would
confess. And the King seeing that it was for the service of
God to hear him in penitence, they seated themselves both at
the foot of the altar. And when the false Hermit spake, it
appeared that he had no sin to confess: for he began to relate
many great services which he had done to God, as well in the
life which he led as in other things. And before the King
could absolve him he rose up, and asked if things were ready
for the mass. And the King said that he knew not, and bade
him look. It was now time that he should go to his oratory.
And the false Hermit asked him that he should assist him in
saying mass, and then he should hear it. And the King said,
that for nothing in the world would he leave to fulfil his
penance, according as it had been appointed him: and he
went to his oratory. And the false Hermit made as if he put
on the vestments and all the ornaments, and began to say
mass, to the end that he might deceive the King, and make
him cease to observe his penance, and come to adore the mass.
And he made a watery cloud arise, so that it rained heavily
where the King was. And when he saw that he could in no
ways entice him, then he went to him, and said, Good man,
for that you may be placed out of danger in cases which at all
times will happen, seeing that you are alone, I have consecrated
the body of Jesus Christ, that you may adore it every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
day, since you may not hear mass; and thus you may fulfil
your penance as a faithful Christian. And with that he dispeeded
himself, saying, In the coffer upon the altar you will
find the Corpus Christi: when you rise from hence go and
adore it. When he had said this, he went his way. And
the King believed that what he said was true, and held that
he was a good man, and of holy life.”</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 249.—<i>How the Holy Ghost visited King Don Rodrigo.</i></p>

<p>“Now when the King had ended his prayers, which he
used to say every day before he took his food, he saw a good
man come towards him, clad in white garments, and with a
fresh countenance and a cheerful, and a cross upon his breast.
And as he arrived where the King was, he blest him; and
when the King saw him he perceived that it was a revelation
of God, and he joined his hands and placed himself on his
knees upon the ground, weeping plentifully. And the holy
man said, King, who art desirous of heavenly glory, continue
the service which thou art performing for the love of my holy
name; and take heed lest the enemy overcome thee, as he
who many times hath overcome thee, whereby thou hast come
to what thou now art. And believe none of all those who
may come to thee here, for they come for no other cause but
only to deceive thee, and withdraw thee from the service which
thou dost me. And always observe the rule given thee by
the holy man whom thou buriedst; for I am content with it,
and thy soul shall receive refreshment if thou observest it.
Come here, and I will show thee how the Devil thought to
deceive thee, that thou mightest adore him. Then the King
arose and went, alway upon his knees, following the Holy
Spirit of God; and when he was within the hermitage, our
Lord spake and said, Depart from hence, thou cursed one,
and go thy way, for thou hast no power to deceive him who
continues in my service. Get thee to the infernal pains which
are suffered by those who are in the ninth torment! And at
that hour the King plainly saw how from the ark, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
upon the altar, there went out a foul and filthy devil, with
more than fifty tails and as many eyes, who, uttering great
yells, departed from the place. And the King was greatly
dismayed at the manner in which the false Hermit had
deceived him. And the Holy Spirit of God said to him,
King, let thy hope be in my name, and I will alway be with
thee, so thou wilt not let thyself be vanquished by the enemy.
Then the Holy Spirit of God departed, and the King
remained full joyful and greatly comforted, as if he had been
in celestial glory. And thus he continued his life for nearly
two months.</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 250.—<i>How the Devil would have deceived King Don Rodrigo
in the figure of Count Don Julian.</i></p>

<p>“The King was in his oratory one Sunday toward nightfall,
just as the sun was setting, when he saw a man coming
toward him, clad in such guise as is fitting for one who follows
arms. And as he looked at him, he saw that it was the Count
Don Julian who approached; and he saw that behind him
there came a great power of armed people. And the false
Count, when he drew nigh, made obeisance to him; and the
King was amazed at seeing him, for he knew him well:
nevertheless he remained still. And the false Count came to
him, and would have kissed his hand, but the King would not
give it, neither would he rise up from the oratory: and the
false Count knelt upon the ground before him, and said, Sir,
forasmuch as I am he who sinned against thee like a man
who is a traitor to his Lord, and as I did it with great wrath
and fury, which possessed my heart through the strength of
the Devil, our Lord God hath had compassion upon me, and
would not that I should be utterly lost, nor that Spain should
be destroyed, nor that thou, sir, shouldst be put down from thy
great honour and state, and the great lordship which thou
hadst in Spain. And he has shown me, in a revelation, how
thou wert here in this hermitage doing this great penance for
thy sins. Wherefore I say to thee, that thou shouldst do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
justice upon me, and take vengeance according to thy will, as
upon one who deserves it, for I acknowledge that thou wert
my lord, and also the great treason into which I have fallen.
Wherefore, sir, I pray and beseech thee by the one only God,
that thou wilt take the power of Spain, which is there awaiting
thee, and that thou wilt go forth to defend the faith
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and suffer not that poor Spain,
should be utterly destroyed, seeing that thou canst defend it
and protect it. And then Count Julian drew his sword, and
gave it to the King, saying, Sir, take this my sword, and with
thine own hand do justice upon me, and take such vengeance
as thou pleasest; for I will suffer it with much patience, seeing
I have sinned against thee. And the King was greatly
troubled at his sight, and at his words also, and knew not
what he should do, neither what he should say. Howbeit,
presently he called to mind what the Holy Spirit of God had
said to him, how he should take heed lest the Devil should
subdue him; and so he said nothing, but continued in his
prayer. And the false Count Don Julian said to him, Sir,
wilt thou not turn for the Holy Faith of Jesus Christ, which
is utterly going to destruction? rise up and defend it, for I
bring thee a full great power; and thus thou wilt serve God
and recover the honour which thou hadst lost. Rise then and
go forth, and have pity upon miserable Spain, which is about
to be lost; and have compassion also upon so many people as
are perishing for want of a Lord who should defend them.
Now all these words were only meant to deceive him, for it
was the Devil who had taken the form of Count Don Julian,
and not the Count himself. But the King could no longer
restrain himself from replying, and he said, Go you, Count,
and defend the land with this force which you have assembled,
even as you went to destroy it by the great treason which you
committed against me and against God. And even as you
brought the men, who are enemies of God and of his Holy
Faith, and led them into Spain, so now thrust them out and
defend it; for I will neither slay you, nor assist you in it.
Leave me to myself; I am no longer for the world, for here I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
will do penance for my sins. Urge me, therefore, no more
with these reasons. And the false Count Don Julian rose,
and went to the great company which he had brought there,
and brought them all before the King. And the King, when
he beheld that great company of knights, saw some among
them whom he surely thought had been slain in battle. And
they all said to him with loud voices, Sir, whom wilt thou
send us, that we may take him for our King and Lord to protect
and defend us, seeing that thou wilt not defend the land,
neither go with us? Wouldst thou give us thy nephew the
Infant Don Sancho? He is dead. What then wouldst thou
command us that we should do? Look to it well, sir; it is
no service of God that thou shouldst let perish so great a
Christianity as is every day perishing, because thou art here
dwelling in this solitude. Look to it, for God will require an
account at thy hands: thou hadst the charge of defending
them, and thou lettest them die. And tell us what course
shall we take. And when the King heard these words he
was moved to compassion: and the tears came into his eyes,
so that he could not restrain them: and he was in such state
that his thoughts failed him, and he was silent, and made no
reply to any thing that they could say. And all these companies
who saw him complained so much the more, and sent
forth great cries, and made a great tumult, and uproar, and
said, O miserable King, why wilt thou not rouse thyself for
thy own sake, and for that of all thy people whom thou seest
without a Lord; and thou wilt not even speak a word to
comfort them, and tell them what they shall do. And all this
while the King did nothing but weep, and answered them
never a word. And when this vile race saw that they could
not take him from thence, and that he answered them nothing,
and that they could not overcome him by whatever they
might do, they went forthwith from the mountain down into
a plain, which was then made to appear before the King, and
there they drew up their battles in such guise as the King
Don Roderigo was used to darrain them. And eft-soon he
saw great multitudes of strange people, who came from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
other side, and they began a battle so fierce and so cruel, that
the King thought he had never seen one like it. And the
one party put the other to the worst, and followed after them
in pursuit. And then there came messengers to the King,
telling him that his people had conquered, and had slain many
of the enemy; but the King was confounded, and as it were
beside himself, and heeded not, neither did he know what
they said, and he answered nothing. And then they all went
away, and seemed to the King that the one were pursuing the
others, and this continued till the first crowing of the cock.
And the King recovered his senses: howbeit he knew not
whether it was a vision, or if it had indeed happened; but he
called to mind that he had not compleated the prayers which
he made every day; and he began them again and finished
them. And when he had finished, great part of the night
was past, and he laid himself down to sleep. And then for
three months he had no other temptation.”</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 251.—<i>How the Devil, in the Figure of La Cava, the
Daughter of Count Don Julian, sought to deceive King Don
Rodrigo.</i></p>

<p>“The King was saying his prayers at the hour of vespers
on a Tuesday, when he saw people on horseback coming toward
him: and as they were about the reach of a cross-bow
from him, he saw that they alighted, and that there came
toward him a woman, who was full nobly clad; and when she
came near, he knew her that she was La Cava, the daughter
of Count Don Julian, and she seemed to him more beautiful
than he had ever before seen her in his life. And when she
drew nigh she humbled herself, and said, Sir, what fortune
has brought you to this wretched life in which you have so
long continued? And the King held his peace and said
nothing. And that false Cava said, Sir, it is a month since
a holy man, clad in white garments, and having a red cross
upon his breast, appeared to me when I was with my father
Count Don Julian in Toledo; where he now holds the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
seat of the lordship of Spain, as he who, by force of arms,
has subdued the Moors, and killed or made captives of them
all. At the hour when this holy man appeared to me I
was alone in my chamber, having great sorrow in my heart,
because I had no certain news where you was, and whether
your soul continued to live in this world, or in another.
And, moreover, I was full sorrowful, because of the death of
my Lady the Queen Eliaca, your wife, who is now deceased.
And for these things my heart was full sorrowful, and in
great trouble with griefs and thoughts, which came to me I
know not from whence, and I was like one bereft of his judgment.
And while I was contemplating in this state, the
holy man appeared to me in such wise as I have said, and
said to me, Of what art thou taking thought? Cease to lament,
for without me thou canst do nothing certain of that
which thou desirest. But that the dominion of Spain may
not pass away from the power of the Goths, and that he who
shall have it may descend from thy seed, and be of the generation
of King Don Rodrigo, it is my will that thou shouldst
know where he is, and that thou shouldst go to him, and that
he should go in unto thee, and that thou shouldst conceive of
him a son, and shalt call his name Felbersan, the which shall
be such a one that he shall reduce under his forces all the
earth which is below the firmament. Depart, therefore, from
hence, and go to the place where he is, and make no tarriance:
for thus it behoveth for the service of God, and for
the weal and protection and defence of the land. And I said
to him, Sir, how can this be which you tell me, seeing that
King Don Rodrigo is dead; for his enemies slew him when they
won the battle in which the great chivalry of Spain perished.
And he said to me, Cava, think not he is dead, for he liveth,
and passeth his life alone in a hermitage; of the which thy
father Count Don Julian will certify thee, for he went to seek
him there, and found him there when he overcame the
Moors. He will tell thee that he is alive, and in what place
is the hermitage wherein he abideth. And I said to him,
But if King Don Rodrigo passeth his life after this manner in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
the service of God, he will not approach me that I may conceive
of him this son who shall prove so good. And since it
thus pleases you, give me a sign by which I may show him
that this is pleasing to God, and that he may do this which
you say, seeing so great good is to follow from it. And,
moreover, he will be brought to such weakness that he will
not be able to obey, by reason of the great abstinence to which
his body has been subjected during his continuance there.
And the holy man said to me, Care not for this, for God will
give him strength; and thou shalt say to him for a sign that
he may believe thee, how I told him that he should take heed
lest the enemy deceive him, and how I bade the Devil depart
from the altar where he was in the ark instead of the Corpus
Christi, for that he should adore him. When thou tellest him
this he will believe thee, and will understand that it is by the
command of God. And when he had said these words he disappeared,
so that I saw him no more; and I remained for a
full hour, being greatly comforted, because I knew of your
life, so that it seemed to me there were no other glory in this
world. And when I came to myself, I went incontinently to
my father Count Don Julian, and told him all that had befallen
me with the holy man who came in that holy vision;
and I asked him if he knew aught concerning you. And he
told me how he had gone to you with all his chivalry to bid
you come out from thence to defend your country, which the
enemies had taken from you, and that you would not; but
rather commended it to him that he should undertake it, and
defend the land and govern it; and that it grieved him to think
that you would not be alive, because of the great abstinence
which you imposed every day upon your flesh: nevertheless,
since it pleases our Lord that I should have a son by you, who
should be so good a man that he should recover all Spain, he
would have me go to this place, where I should find you if
you were alive; and right content would he be that there
should remain of you so great good. And I, sir King, seeing
how it pleased God that this should be accomplished, according
as I have said, am come here in secret, for neither man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
nor woman knoweth of this, save my father Count Don
Julian; for I have told my people who came with me to
remain yonder, because I would go and confess to a holy man
who had made his abode here more than fifty years. Now,
since God is the author of this, recover yourself, and remember
the time when you told me that there was nothing in the world
which you loved so much as me, nor which you desired so
greatly as to obtain a promise of me; the which I could not
give at that hour, by reason that the Queen was living, and I
knew it to be great sin. And if I come to you now, it is by
command of God, for it pleases him to send me here; and,
also, because the Queen is no longer in this present life. And
because you are so fallen away of your strength, let us go into
the hermitage, or I will order a tent to be placed here, and let
us sup together, that your heart may revive and you may fulfil
the command of God.”</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 252.—<i>How the Devil would have deceived King Don
Rodrigo, if the Holy Spirit had not visited and protected him.</i></p>

<p>“As the King heard all this his whole body began to
tremble, and his soul within him also; and all sense and
power past away from him, so that he was in a trance, and
then it was revealed to him that he should take heed against
that temptation. And the false Cava, who saw him thus entranced,
made many burning torches of wax come there, by
reason that it was cold, and because that the King should
derive heat; also there was a pavilion pitched there, and a
table set within it with many viands thereon, and all the
people who came with her were seen to lodge themselves
far away upon the mountain. And when he had recovered
himself, he saw that the false Cava was drest in a close-fitting
kirtle, which came half way below the knee, and she seemed
to him the fairest woman that he had ever seen in his life, and
it appeared to the King that she said to him, Here, sir, come
and take your supper. And the King began again to tremble
and lose his judgment, and fell into such a state that he knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
not where he was, and it was revealed to him in that hour that
he should guard against the temptation. And when he came
to himself he saw that the pavilion was spread over his head;
and seeing himself in that place, he looked for the oratory, and
perceived that it was where it used to be; and within the pavilion
he saw the false Cava, who was there with him, and that
she was standing beside a bed, which was a full rich one, and
that she began to take off her kirtle, and remained in her shift
only, and with her long hair, which reached to her feet; and
she said to him, See, sir, here in your power, that which you
most desired, and which is now awaiting you. Rejoice, then,
and take heart, and do that which God has appointed, and
which will recover Spain, and recompense the losses, and sorrows,
and wrongs which you have endured. And then
she turned toward the King, for the Devil thought thus to
tempt him, and make him break the penance which he had
begun; and certes I ween there was no living man who would
not right gladly have approached her. And then before him, in
his sight, she began to comb and to plait her golden locks. And
the King, seeing how beautiful she was, began to tremble all
over, as if he had been struck with palsy; and he lost his
judgment again, and became entranced, and remained thus a
long while before he came again to himself. And it was revealed
to him again that he should take heed how the Devil
tempted him, and that he should have firm hope in God,
and not break the penance which the holy Hermit had appointed
him. But ever when he recovered from these trances,
he forgot all which had been revealed to him while he
was entranced; and now he found that there was a large
<i>estrado</i> placed by him, and that La Cava was lying there beside
him on some pillows, which were richly wrought in gold, undrest,
as he had seen her, and that she said to him, Come, sir,
for you tarry long, and it will soon be day-break. And the
King seeing her so near him, then he was greatly troubled, yet
could he not withdraw his eyes from her: but he called to
mind how the Holy Spirit of God had bade him that he should
always confide in his name, and place his true hope in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
sign of the cross. And he clasped his hands, and lifted them
towards Heaven, and weeping bitterly, and in great contrition,
he said, O Lord and very God, Jesus Christ, deliver me from
all temptation, and preserve my soul, that it fall not into perdition.
And while he was praying thus, he saw how there came
from the hermitage a great brightness, and he said, Deliver
me, Lord, from the power of the Devil, that I may not be
deceived, nor withdrawn from thy holy service. And at that
hour he made the sign of the cross upon his forehead, and
blest himself; and at that hour the false Cava fell down
the rock into the sea, with such a sound as if the whole
world were falling to pieces, and with the plunge which she
made the sea dashed up so high, that where the oratory was
the King was wetted with the spray. And he remained in
such astonishment, that he could not for an hour recover himself.
And when he came to himself he began to pray with
great repentance, as if he had been on the point of falling into
temptation. And the Holy Spirit of God came to him in that
same manner in which he had seen it the former time. And
he fell on his face upon the ground, and began to lament full
bitterly, and to say, Lord, have mercy upon my soul, and forsake
me not among mine enemies, who would withdraw me
from thee. And the Holy Spirit said to him, O King, of little
faith, how hast thou been on the point of perishing! And the
King made no reply, for he did nothing but weep. And the
Holy Spirit of God said to him, Take heed, King, lest the
Devil deceive thee, and have power over thee, that thou
shouldst not fulfil the penance which thou hast commenced,
neither save thy soul. And the King lifted up his countenance,
and had great shame to behold him. Howbeit he took courage,
and said, Lord, have mercy upon me, and let me not be
tempted by the enemy, for my heart is weak, and hath no
power to defend itself against the false one: for my judgement
is clean confounded, as one who hath no virtue if he be not
aided by thy grace. Deliver me, Lord, for thy holy mercy
and compassion: my salvation cannot come through the
strength of my heart, for it is wholly full of fear, like a thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
which is overcome. And the Holy Spirit of God said to him,
Take courage and fear not, for thou shalt depart from this
place sooner than thou thinkest. And when it is time I will
guide thee to the place where thou shalt do thy penance, that
thy soul may receive salvation. When thou shalt see a little
white cloud appear above thee, and that there is no other in
the sky, follow after it: and in the place where it shall stop
shalt thou fulfil thy penance, according as the chief priest in
that place shall appoint it thee. And take heart, and alway
call to mind my holy name, and have true faith and constant
hope in thy Saviour. And when he had said this he departed.
And the King was greatly comforted and full of grace, as one
with whom God was present in his mercy. And he abode in
the hermitage a whole year, according to his reckoning, and
twelve days more. And one day, when it was full clear, the
King looked up and saw above him the cloud of which the
Holy Spirit of God had told him; and when he saw it he was
full joyful, and gave many thanks to God. Nevertheless the
King did not rise from his prayers, neither did the cloud move
from above him. And when he had finished his prayers
he looked at the cloud and saw that it moved forward.”</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 253.—<i>How King Don Rodrigo departed from the Hermitage,
and arrived where he was to do penance.</i></p>

<p>“The King arose from the oratory and followed the cloud;
and so great was the pleasure which he had, that he cared not
for food, neither remembered it, but went after that his holy
guide. And at night he saw how the cloud, when the sun was
about to set, turned to the right of the road toward the mountains;
and it went on so far, that before night had closed it
came to a hermitage, in which there was a good man for a
Hermit, who was more than ninety years of age, and there it
stopt. And the King perceived that he was to rest there, and
the good man welcomed the King, and they spake together of
many things. And the King was well contented with his
speech, and saw that certes he was a servant of God. And all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
that day the King had not eaten, and he was barefoot, and his
raiment tattered: and as he had not been used to travel a-foot,
and with his feet bare, his feet were swollen with blisters. And
when it was an hour after night, the Hermit gave him a loaf,
full small, which was made of rye, and there were ashes
kneaded with it, and the King ate it: and when he had eaten
they said prayers. And when they had said their hours, they
lay down to sleep. And when it was midnight they arose and
said their hours: and when they had said them, the King went
out of the hermitage, and saw that the cloud did not move:
and then the King understood that he had to tarry here, or
that he was to hear mass before he departed, and he asked the
Hermit to hear his confession, and the Hermit confessed him.
And when he had confessed, he said that he would communicate,
and the good Hermit saw that it was good, and he put on
his vestments and said mass; and the King heard the mass,
and received the very body of our Lord Jesus Christ. And
when the King had done this, he went out to look at the cloud.
And as he went out of the hermitage he saw that the cloud
began to move, and then he dispeeded himself from the Hermit,
and they embraced each other weeping, and each entreated
the other, that he would bear him in mind, and
remember him in his prayers. And when the King had
dispeeded himself, he followed after his holy guide, and the
holy Hermit returned to his hermitage. And the King Don
Rodrigo, notwithstanding his feet were swollen and full of
blisters, and that in many places they were broken and bleeding,
such and so great was the joy which he felt at going on in
the course which he now held, that he endured it all as though
he felt nothing. And he went, according as it seemed to him,
full six leagues, and arrived at a convent of Black Monks, and
there the cloud stopt, and would proceed no farther. And at
that convent there was an Abbot who led an extraordinary
good and holy life; and they were not there like other monks;
and he was a great friend of God and of our Lady the Virgin
St. Mary: and this Abbot took the King to his cell, and
asked if he would eat as he was wont to do, or like the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
monks, and the King said, that he would do as he should
direct him. And the Abbot ordered that a loaf should be
brought of pannick and maize mixed together, and a jar of water,
and on the other side he had food placed such as the monks
used; and the King would eat only of the pannick bread, as
he had been wont to do, and he drank of the water. And
when he had eaten, the Abbot asked him if he would remain
that night or not, and the King said that he knew not, but
that he would go out and see whether he were to go or to remain.
And the Abbot said that it was the hour of vespers,
and that he ought to remain; and the King went out and saw
that the cloud moved, and that it behoved him to go, and he
dispeeded himself from the Abbot, and they commended themselves
each to the other in his prayers. And the Abbot saw
plainly how that cloud had guided him, and how there was no
other in the sky, and he marvelled greatly, and said, Certes
this is some holy man, and he gave thanks to God. And the
King went on that evening till he came to a church which was
solitary and remote from peopled places: and there the cloud
stopt, and he abode there that night. And the King went
into the church, and found in it a lamp burning, and it rejoiced
him much, for by the light of it he said his hours as well
before he should sleep as after. And on the morrow when he
had made his prayer, he went out of the church and beheld the
cloud, and saw that it moved; and he went after it, and after
two days’ journey he came to a place which where it is, or what
it is called, is not said, save that it is the place of his burial,
for such it is. And there the cloud stopt and proceeded no
farther; and it rested without the town over an ancient hermitage.
And the elder of that place incontinently knew by
the Holy Spirit how King Don Rodrigo was come there: but
he knew not his name, neither who he was; and he asked him
if he meant to lead his life there, and he answered that it was
to be as God should please. And the Elder said to him,
Friend, I am the Elder of this place, for all the others, when
they knew that King Don Rodrigo and his chivalry were slain
and vanquished, fled from hence for fear of the Moors, and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
the traitor Count Don Julian, and they all went to the mountains
to escape. And I remained, putting my trust in our
Lord God, and in his holy hands: for that I would rather
abide that which may befall and take my adventure here, than
utterly forsake our mother holy church; while I am able I
will remain here and not forsake it, but rather receive my
death. And therefore I say, that if you are to abide here you
must provide yourself of that whereof you have need. And
the King said, Friend of God, concerning my tarriance I
cannot certify you; though surely I think that I shall abide;
and if for the service of God you will be pleased to send me
every day that I remain a loaf of pannick and water, I shall
be contented therewith. And the Elder promised this, and
departed forthwith and went to his home, and sent him a loaf
of pannick and water. And the cloud remained there three
days over that hermitage, and when the three days were at
an end, it was seen no more. And the King, when he could
no longer see it, understood that there he must perform his
penance, and gave many thanks to God, and was full joyful
thereat. And on the morrow the Elder came to see him, and
they communed with each other in such manner, that the
King confessed to him all the sins which he had committed
during his whole life till that time, all which he called to mind
with great contrition, weeping full bitterly and groaning for
his errors and sins. And the Elder was greatly astonished,
and said, That on the third day from thence he would appoint
him his penance. And he went to his church and confessed,
and addrest himself to prayer in such guise that he neither ate
nor drank, nor raised himself from one place, weeping bitterly,
and beseeching God that he would show him what penance he
should appoint the King; for after no other manner did he
think to appoint it, than such as his holy mercy and compassion
should direct. And on the third day he heard a voice
which said thus, Command King Don Rodrigo that he go to
a fountain which is below his hermitage, and he shall find
there a smooth stone; and bid him lift it up, and under it he
shall find three little serpents, the one having two heads. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
bid him take that which hath two heads, and carry it away,
and place it in a jar, and nurse it secretly, so that no person
in the world shall know thereof, save only he and thou; and
let him keep it till it wax so great that it hath made three
turns within the jar, and puts its head out; and when it is of
that greatness, then let him take it out, and lay it in a tomb
which is there, and lie down himself with it, naked; and close
the tomb well, that the serpent may not be able to go out; and
in this manner God is pleased that King Don Rodrigo should
do penance.”</p>

<p class="heading">Ch. 254.—<i>Of the Penance which was appointed King Don
Rodrigo.</i></p>

<p>“The Elder when he heard the voice was greatly amazed at
so rigorous a penance as this, and gave many thanks to God,
and he went to King Don Rodrigo, and told him the manner
how he had heard the voice; and the King was full joyful and
content and pleased therewith, and gave many thanks to our
Lord, for that he should now complete his penance and save
his soul. And therewith in great joy, and shedding many
tears for pleasure, he went to the fountain as he had been directed,
and found the smooth stone. And when he had lifted
it up, he found the three serpents according as the Elder had
said, and he took that which had two heads, and he took it and
put it in a great jar, such as would be a large wine vessel, and
nurst it there till it was of such bigness as the voice had said.
And when King Don Rodrigo saw that it was of this bigness
he confessed to the Elder, weeping full bitterly, demanding
favour of God that he would give him grace and strength with
patience to fulfil that penance without any temptation or
trouble of soul; to the end that, the penance being completed,
it might please our Lord God to receive his soul into his
glory. And before the fifth day after the serpent was thus
big, the King and the Elder went to the tomb, and they
cleansed it well within; and the King placed himself in it
naked as he was born, and the serpent with him, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
Elder with a great lever laid the stone upon the top. And the
King besought the Elder that he would pray to our Lord to
give him grace that he might patiently endure that penance,
and the Elder promised him, and thus the King remained in
his tomb, and the serpent with him. And the Elder consoled
him, saying to him many things to the end that he
might not be dismayed, neither fall into despair, whereby he
should lose the service of God. And all this was so secret
that no man knew it, save only the King and the Elder. And
when it was day-break the Elder went to the church and said
mass, with many tears and with great devotion beseeching
God that he would have mercy and compassion upon King Don
Rodrigo, that with true devotion and repentance he might complete
his penance in this manner, which was for his service.
And when he had said mass, he went to the place where
King Don Rodrigo lay, and asked him how he fared, and the
King answered, Well, thanks to God, and better than he deserved,
but that as yet he was just as when he went in. And
the Elder strengthened him as much as he could, telling him
that he should call to mind how he had been a sinner, and that
he should give thanks to our Lord God, for that he had visited
him in this world, and delivered him from many temptations,
and had himself appointed for him this penance; the which he
should suffer and take with patience, for soon he would be in
heavenly glory. And the king said to him, that he well knew
how according to his great sins he merited a stronger penance:
but that he gave many thanks to our Lord Jesus, for that he
himself had given him this penance, which he did receive and
take with great patience; and he besought the Elder that he
would continue to pray our Lord God that he would let
him fulfil it. And the Elder said to him many good things
concerning our Lord God. And the King lay there three
days, during all which time the serpent would not seize on
him. And when the third day, after that he had gone into the
tomb, was completed, the serpent rose from his side, and crept
upon his belly and his breast, and began with the one head to
eat at his nature, and with the other straight toward his heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
And at this time the Elder came to the tomb, and asked him
how he fared, and he said, Well, thanks to God, for now the
serpent had begun to eat. And the Elder asked him at what
place, and he answered at two, one right against the heart with
which he had conceived all the ills that he had done, and the
other at his nature, the which had been the cause of the great
destruction of Spain. And the Elder said that God was with
him, and exhorted him that he should be of good courage, for
now all his persecutions both of the body and of the soul would
have an end. And the King ceased not always to demand
help of our Lord, and to entreat that of his holy mercy he
would be pleased to forgive him. And the Elder went to his
home, and would not seat himself to eat, but retired into his
chamber, and weeping, prayed full devoutly to our Lord that
he would give strength to the King that he might complete
his penance. And the serpent, as he was dying for hunger,
and moreover was large, had in one minute eaten the nature,
and began to eat at the bowels; nevertheless he did not eat so
fast, but that the King endured in that torment from an hour
before night till it was past the middle of the day. And when
the serpent broke through the web of the heart, he staid there
and ate no further. And incontinently the King gave up his
spirit to our Lord, who by his holy mercy took him into his
glory. And at that hour when he expired all the bells of the
place rang of themselves as if men had rung them. Then
the Elder knew that the King was dead, and that his soul was
saved.”</p>

<p>Thomas Newton in his “Notable History of the Saracens,”
seems to imagine that this story is allegorical. “Nowe,” he
says, “whereas it is reported, and written that he folowed a
starre or a messenger of God, which conducted and guided
him in his way; it may be so, and the same hath also happened
to others; but it may as well also be understoode of a
certaine secrete starre moving and directing his will.</p>

<p>“And whereas they say he was put by that holy man into a
cave or hole, and a serpent with him that had two heads, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
in two days’ space gnawed all the flesh off his body from the
bones; this, beyng simplie taken and understanded, hath no
likelihood of any truth. For what sanctity, what religion, or
what pietie, commandeth to kill a penitent person, and one
that seeketh comfort of hys afflicted mind by amendment of
life, with such horrible torments and straunge punishment?
Wherefore I woulde rather think it to be spoken mysticallye,
and that the serpent with two heads signifieth his sinful and
gylty conscience.”</p>

<p class="heading"><i>How Carestes found the grave of King Don Rodrigo at Viseo
in Portugal.</i></p>

<p>“I, Carestes, vassal of King Don Alfonso of Leon, son-in-law
of the Knight of God, King Don Pelayo, when the said
King Don Alfonso won Viseo from the Moors who held it,
found a grave in a field, upon the which were written in
Gothic letters, the words which you shall here read. This
grave was in front of a little church, without the town of Viseo,
and the superscription of the writing was thus:—</p>

<p class="heading"><i>Of the writing which was upon the grave of King Don Rodrigo.</i></p>

<p>“Here lies King Don Rodrigo, the last of the Goths.
Cursed be the wrath of the traitor Julian, for it was of long
endurance, and cursed be his anger, for it was obdurate and
evil, for he was mad with rage, and stomachful with pride,
and puffed up with folly, and void of loyalty, and unmindful
of the laws, and a despiser thereof; cruel in himself, a slayer
of his lord, a destroyer of his country, a traitor to his countrymen;
bitter is his name; and it is as grief and sorrow in
the mouth of him who pronounces it; and it shall always be
cursed by all that speak of him.”</p>

<p>That veracious chronicler Carestes then concludes his true
history in these words:—“And by this which I found
written upon this grave, I am of mind that King Don Rodrigo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
lies there, and because of the life which he led in his
penitence, according as ye have heard, which also was in the
same tomb written in a book of parchment, I believe without
doubt that it is true, and because of the great penance which
he did, that God was pleased to make it known in such
manner as it past, for those who hereafter shall have to rule
and govern, to the end that all men may see how soon pride is
abased and humility exalted. This Chronicle is composed in
memory of the noble King Don Rodrigo; that God pardon
his sins, and that the son of the Virgin without stain, Jesus
Christ, bring us to true repentance, who liveth and reigneth
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="center">Thanks be to God!”</p>

<p>I believe the Archbishop Roderick of Toledo is the earliest
writer who mentions this discovery. He died in 1247. The
fact may very possibly have been true, for there seems to have
been no intention of setting up a shrine connected with it.
The Archbishop’s words are as follow:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Quid de Rege Roderico acciderit ignoratur; tamen corona,
vestes et insignia et calciamenta auro et lapidibus adornata, et
equus qui Orelia dicebatur, in loco tremulo juxta fluvium sine
corpore sunt inventa. Quid autem de corpore fuerit factum penitus
ignoratur, nisi quod modernis temporibus apud Viseum civitatem
Portugalliæ inscriptus tumulus invenitur</i>, Hic jacet Rodericus
ultimus Rex Gothorum. <i>Maledictus furor impius Juliani
quia pertinax, et indignatio, quia dura; animosus indignatione,
impetuosus furore, oblitus fidelitatis, immemor religionis, contemptor
divinitatis, crudelis in se, homicida in dominum, hostis in domesticos,
vastator in patriam, reus in omnes, memoria ejus in
omni ore amarescet, et nomen ejus in æternum putrescet.</i>”—Rod.
